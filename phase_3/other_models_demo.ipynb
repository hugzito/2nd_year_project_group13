       " 18: 'Few can turn Scripture into song as well as Michael Card. His lyrics cover every book in the Bible, but his new CD focuses on the gospel of Luke.\\n\\nThis collection is associated with Luke: The Gospel of Amazement, which is the first of four commentaries on the gospels in Card\\'s Biblical Imagination Series. A commentary and CD on the remaining gospels will be released in each of the next three years.\\n\\nCard is currently hosting Biblical Imagination seminars across the country teaching how to \"engage with Scripture at the level of the informed imagination.\" Judging from the quality of the commentary, and the response that he is receiving from the seminars, these events are worth attending.\\n\\nThose who know Card\\'s music recognize that it has always been informed by the Scriptures, but with the release of his new commentary, it\\'s apparent that he is a scholar, having been mentored by the late William Lane.\\n\\nHis exposition of Luke provides the basis for these songs, which cover the life of Christ from beginning to end. For those who appreciate nativity songs, there are three that cover: the Magnificant (\"What Sort of Song?\"), Christ\\'s birth (\"A King in a Cattle Trough\"), and His dedication in the temple (\"Simeon\\'s Song\"). Jeff Taylor\\'s gentle accordion beautifully ties all three together.\\n\\nAcoustic guitar and piano predominate making this a mellower, more folk-oriented offering than some earlier releases that had more pop and rock influences. It\\'s relaxed, mature and inspiring.\\n\\nHe employs banjo and uilleann pipes on an instrumental (\"A Little Boy Lost\") and on the last song (\"Seven Endless Miles\"). His banjo playing is not fast, but steady and strong, and the interplay with the pipes is a delight. It gives these songs a Celtic feel.\\n\\n\"The Pain and Persistence of Doubt,\" set between the crucifixion and the resurrection, is just piano and strings at their most mournful. It captures a mood of melancholy, since Christ\\'s followers were not expecting him to rise. The somber tone has a beauty of its own.\\n\\nCommunity is important to Michael Card. He sees the creative muse springing from collaboration rather than solitude. Three of his four children contribute, along with Matthew Ward (2nd Chapter of Acts), Kirk Whalum, Scott Roley and others. Matthew Ward and Kirk Whalum (saxophone) are featured on the opening standout track (\"A World Turned Upside Down\"), and Ward also sings on \"A Breath of a Prayer,\" which is a combination of the Jesus Prayer and the Lord\\'s Prayer. Matthew Ward\\'s contribution drew me to this release, and though he and Card have been singing for many years, their voices remain strong.\\n\\nOn \"Freedom,\" Card starts off singing, \"I am lost and I am bound / And I am captive to the shame that keeps holding me down.\" With just piano, strings and vocals he succeeds in capturing the heart\\'s cry to be free from the burden of sin. I also appreciate that he continually points to Christ as the answer. He is our freedom. He is the bread and wine. Card doesn\\'t get any better than this for me. Each of his recordings has a gem like this that resonates deeply.\\n\\nIronically, this is the only song that is not directly tied to a passage in Luke. Perhaps it says something about the challenge of adapting scripture to song, which can make it sound wooden. More likely, \"Freedom\" is a favorite because the lyrics are personal and vulnerable, making them highly relatable to all of us who feel the burden of being human in a broken world.\\n\\nI welcome scripture songs like the ones found here for the truth and life they contain. It\\'s not hard to appreciate how artful Michael Card is with these texts. Best of all, he fashions them in such a way that they point to Christ. He is the way, the truth and the life.',\n",

My kids said that they only remembered the stories and not the words.

It doesn\\'t say how much the sound is slowed down, because chirps cannot ever sound like a boys\\' choir as played on this CD. Bear with me here: 1. Speed: I found two references online, one said 8x slower (at that point, we\\'d still hear chirpiness, individual beats within a chirp, and gaps between chirps, albeit everything at an almost inaudibly low frequency). The other reference said \"proportional to human:cricket life, which, for 4-6 months to 65 years would be 130-195x slower. At that point, a 1/8 second gap (very conservative estimate) between chirps would become 15-25 second gap of silence, every minute to three minutes (for 1/2 second to 1 second chirps). At that point, a chirp at a well-audible max frequency of, say, 1000 Hz would become 5 - 8 Hz (humans can\\'t hear below 20 Hz). To make a good slowed down audio at standard CD sampling rate of 44100 samples/second (used on CDs and standard CD-equivalent quality MP3s), you need an equipment that can handle about 6.6 million samples per second. Without this equipment, all you get when you stretch is artifact of your computer programs, nothing much from the original sound recording. (still, the 15-25 second or longer gaps of silence would be there).\\nAnd what does a single chirp really sound like when you slow down to 8x? You can then hear the individual beats within a chirp. It still sounds like super-low frequency chirping, with a single prominent frequency within each beat (go to controls, click on change display to see frequency amplitudes, to see that there is a bold unceasing frequency within each chirp).

From his Mason Proffit Years rubbing shoulders with the likes of Janis Joplin and many other great singers and bands from the late 60\\'s and early 70\\'s.  JMT is far from his roots. You will find this collection a mere  drop in a bucket compared to his complete library, but more than likely, not everyone reading this will find themselves owning his complete library.  But this is a great start.  This I think is a perfect start!  It has most all of My personal Favorite songs like...\"Lilies of the Field\"......\"Healer of my Soul\"....\"Hiding Place\".....\"The Pleiades and Oriion\"...and \"Sunrise\". I am not Catholic, but I don\\'t believe JMT is directing his efforts strickly toward one denomination. This music is a celebration of Jesus Christ.....it sooths the spririt and allows your life to slow down and realise there is so much more and different to music and the Spirit in which you take it all in. You will find his music has a touch of Brilliance to each song. His Guitar picking is something to be awed at. The String arrangements heard on many of these songs are full and breathtaking and sensative to your heart. His Voice is something I imagine God Himself enjoying from Heaven.

There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.\\n\\nAs with their previous albums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles.  'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.

But with that being said, this CD just wasn\\'t very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with \"If We Are The Body\" and \"Does Anybody Hear Her,\" but with \"What This World Needs,\" it\\'s just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn\\'t doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!\\n\\nThis CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD\\'s had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn\\'t get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.

If the record company was to include MJ's lp tracks, they should put in Lady In My Life or Workin' Day & Night.

Cliff's bass playing is too valuable of a thing not to raise it a notch or so in the mix. They should've lowered the guitars a bit in order to raise the bass some, since the guitars already benefit from a higher pitched, more definable sound whereas the bass needs extra lovin' in the mix to make individual notes and fills more audible.\\n\\nWith that being said, you can hear more definition in Cliff's bass sound and you can also hear (and feel) Lars's bass drum better, which results in a more satisfying low-end sound than the original.\\n\\nAlso, some people said that they heard clipping sounds on this new version. I cranked it on my sound system and heard nothing of the sort.\\n\\nThis remastered version is best listened to and appreciated through a good quality sound system (at as high of a volume as your family or neighbors will allow) rather than on an i-pod through headphones.

I see a lot of revues that say this album sounds great and either these people have really bad ears, really bad equipment that they think is good or worse yet, both. I have the original \\'Megaforce\" pressing of this album and I promise you will never find a better sounding copy anywhere. Even the printing of the sleeve is far superior to any other pressing. These can still be had for very near the price of the halfspeed mastered or maybe a lttle more. If you want the original sound, seek out and buy a \\'MINT\" or \"NM\" \"Megaforce\" pressing Ride the lightning. It will have the number \"MRI 769\" on the spine and on the back. This is how you can tell you have the original. Not only will you have the best recording in your hands, you will also own a piece of history in your hands, instead of a piece of crap. Even if you can\\'t find one of these, find a original \"Electra\" copy and the quality will still be far better than all the rest. They are not too cheap either but worth every penny over the newer version on cheap vinyl. But don\\'t just take my word on it, see what others are saying and save your money for the good stuff.\\n\\n[...]',\n",

       " 280: 'Metallica follow up \"Kill \\'Em All\" with a keener sense of structure and  artistic approach. On their sophomore recording, the boys demonstrate a natural ability to build tension, balance dissonance and consonance, orchestrate melody and harmony and find resolution. They didn\\'t just raise the bar, they went to another dimension and still somehow topped themselves on the next few records. Arguably, each album stands by itself and is a testament to anyone who dreams, while inspiring new generations to just do it.\\n\\nThis album contains many sides to the band that, good and bad, shocked it\\'s audience.\\n\"Fight Fire With Fire\" - Deceptively starts the album at 82 bpm with a beautiful and serene atmosphere (a metaphor for a peaceful, unsuspecting public during the cold war era) that suddenly erupts like an explosion to 184 bpm, blasting the listener unrelentlessly for almost five minutes, proving they could be beautifully ugly when they felt like it. This song bashes your face in. Awesome!\\n\"Ride The Lightning\" - The song starts with a dissonant harmony that resolves to a dissonant rhythm. Later in the song the solo guitar performs a triplet harmony that morphs into a sixteenth harmony seamlessly, a feat not easily accomplished but executed masterfully here.\\n\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" - A solemn bell sets the cadence, warning of the approaching harmonized bass figure. Who harmonizes bass guitar? Cliff, that\\'s who and he does it well. Wow, this song is awesome. Drums lay down a strong backbone for the rhythm figures and guitar harmonies, while tossing out fills when appropriate. The lyrics focus on the horrors of war as described by Ernest Hemingway. I still wonder where these guys went after 1992.\\n\"Fade To Black\" - Awesome song with some stirring emotional moments. The solos, the acoustic verse riffs, the ending double bass figure that builds and builds, the lost feeling and the fade out totally serve every second of this song.\\n\"Trapped Under Ice\" - Not a favorite, but rhythmically it explores more land Metallica was conquering.\\n\"Escape\" - an ode to Iron Maiden\\'s \"The Prisoner\": again, not a favorite, but it\\'s another experiment in the dissonant world.\\n\"Creeping Death\" - Being a Christian, The fact that the lyrics are a condensed version of the book of Exodus is just awesome. The repeating rhythmic percussive phrase and chant of \"Die\" every other beat is beyond powerful. It\\'s an anthem and something many have tried to copy but can\\'t reproduce.\\n\"The Call of Ktulu\" - This song is a symphonic poem. Listening to the song paints some very graphic pictures in one\\'s head. I can just envision this giant climbing out of the sea destroying the corrupted world and then going back to sleep in the depths of the ocean. This instrumental is epic.\\n\\nMelodically and contrapuntally, this albums goes where Metallica has never been before. James, Lars, Kirk, and more so Cliff, added a dimension that served the music and, a purposely overlooked, genre very well, giving it credence while the arrogant world still looked the other way.',\n",
       " 281: \"How did this awful crap get 5 stars? I was a big big fan of their albums Load, Reload, and the awesome St. Anger, so I decided to give this one a try.\\n\\nFirst off, the bass is awful! I'm so glad that Cliff died, because he tried to play bass like Limp Bizkit and failed. Also, the songs are abysmal. In For Whom the Bell Tolls, they try to emulate St. Anger and put no solos in it, but it fails. And Fade to Black is an obvious attempt to be emo, but it did not make me want to cut my wrists. All the other tracks on the album are bad as well, and James' voice sounds prepubescent.\\n\\nGet St. Anger instead.\",\n",
       " 282: 'If you listen to their music in order, this album is a tremendous step forward from their 1st album. Not that Kill Em All was bad because it was very good, but now they have depth and progression in their music. It is not just straight forward thrash. And this is the beginning of the blueprint for MOP, AJFA and now Death Magnetic in terms of where songs are placed. Title track is 2nd, opening track starts with a slow, acoustic style and then rips into a fast pace, 4th track is the ballad type song and then at the end you have your instrumental.\\n\\nWhile I do not care much for Escape and Trapped Under Ice, the rest of the tracks are just so stunning that I had to give it 5 stars. Creeping Death is my favorite. Fade to Black is their 1st attempt of a slower type ballad song. The Call of Ktulu is a beautiful instrumental and Whom The Bell Tolls and Fight Fire With Fire are awesome.\\n\\nDefinitely check this album out. It is my 2nd favorite behind Master of Puppets.',\n",

The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into \"Master of Puppets,\" arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing \"Fade to Black\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track \"The Call of Ktulu.\"\\n\\nDefinitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you\\'re just getting into the band.',\n",
       " 284: \"This is one of the worst sounding LPs I have ever come across. I'm not attacking the album itself, it's still the classic we know and love, but something went horribly wrong with the mastering of this new vinyl edition. It's unlistenable. It sounds muffled and distorted. I am so disappointed. Stick with the vintage LP releases and don't mess with these new pressings.\",\n",
       " 285: 'I compared this pressing to my Megaforce 33rpm pressing that I bought new in the 80s that is perfect condition. I played both on a high-end turntable (Basis/TriPlanar/Lyra) set-up through a tube preamp/solid state power amp and Sound Lab speakers with a Velodyne sub. Even during the mellow introduction I could tell that the Megaforce was much better. To my ears, the \"original\" (in quotes because it was first issued on a private label) issue\\'s bass was tighter and went deeper, and the highs were more distinct and extended. The double kick on \"Fight Fire With Fire\" was much easier to make out, and with the volume high enough the drums and bass guitar shook my gut. The volume didn\\'t need to be turned up nearly as loud to reach a banging your head experience. The re-issue could not perform these feats.\\n  I know they claim that they used the original master tapes to make this new 45rpm re-issue, but perhaps the tapes have aged to a point where they are just plain old worn out. I can\\'t see how this could be, really, because I have many re-issues of other titles and genres that have supposedly been pressed from the original masters that are nearly 40 years old, and they sound fantastic.\\n  I was disappointed with this pressing, to say the least. As a big Metallica fan I was hoping that this would be the \"ultimate\" pressing, but no way.\\n  I have to hand it to them, though. The thick cardboard gatefold cover is great. The thick vinyl is perfectly flat, and the vinyl surfaces are silent underneath the music and between tracks (when there is an actual space between the tracks).\\n  I\\'m going to play my old version again. What a great record!',\n",
       " 286: \"After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.\\n\\nAfter that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.\\n\\nBut the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.\\n\\nAll up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.\",\n",

This is one of their best. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" \"Fade to Black,\" \"Creeping Death,\" and \"Fight Fire With Fire\" are all very good classic Metallica. For Who the Bell Tolls is my favorite lyric song (I love the lyrics). This album is slightly overrated but still good.',\n",

       " 290: 'Just finished reviewing \"Master of puppets\" and as for that album, I\\'ll just say that I am not a heavy metal fan as such. This review is just to help people that are curious about the band and aren\\'t really fans of heavy metal either. Hopefully I can indentify some songs for you on the album which have \\'cross-over\\' appeal. I tend to like \"hook\" laden songs, and the one below has a terrific melody for a hook.\\n\\nThis album has one out and out terrific song-\\n\\nFade to black:\\n\\nThis song has a nice accoustic introduction, that bleeds into a beautiful guitar melody about the one minute mark. Yes...beautiful. Heavy metal and beautiful...doesn\\'t seem right, does it? As with Master of Puppets \"Welcome Home\", I initially disliked the part where the music veered into heavy metal territory. However, this song has grown on me more than Welcome Home has. This is perhaps Metallica\\'s best song ever-or at least, in the same league as Enter Sandman, which is currently my favourite Metallica song. The sheer magnitude of the heavy metal guitar sounds in the latter part of the song was initially off putting, but I have warmed to it, and it\\'s not so weird to me anymore.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the album-\\n\\nFight fire with fire:\\n\\nThis song is the best of the rest. Again, it has a very nice accoustic guitar intro-Spanish flavoured, perhaps, before veering off into heavy metal territory.\\n\\nNothing else really stands out on this album-The call of Ktulu is not in the same class as an instrumental as Master of Puppets\\' \"Orion\". It does have some interesting, creepy effects though.\\n\\nIn Metallica\\'s favour, though, is that they are not afraid to mix up their song\\'s feel. Trapped Under Ice, and Escape have an interesting vibe to them.\\n\\nShould Metallica ever release a best of album, I think that Fade To Black is a definite must have selection. A best of album which included Welcome Home, Fade to black, Memory Remains, Enter Sandman and Orion would be a great album. It\\'s unfortunate that Metallica haven\\'t really ever released a great album...at least not with more than one song that I really like [p.s. Reload changes that...see my review of that great album here].\\n\\nN.B. I\\'ve also reviewed the following Metallica cds at this site:\\n\\nReload\\n\\nLoad\\n\\nand Master of puppets\\n\\nas well as Megadeth\\'s \"Greatest hits\", a Black Sabbath compilation and Iron Maiden\\'s \"Ed Hunter\" cd.\\n\\nP.P.S. Here are some songs I consider to be classics of the metal genre:\\n\\nMetallica: Fade to black\\n\\nMegadeth: Prince of darkness\\n\\nIron Maiden: Run to the hills [though it doesn\\'t have the quality of the other two in terms of me being willing to listen to it over and over and over again in a short period of time]\\n\\nAC/DC: Hell\\'s bells',\n",

       " 292: \"Ride the Lightning was Metallica's first real step towards greatness. This cd starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, a song with a mellow intro that explodes into a menacing riff. Following that is the partially Mustaine written title track. For Whom the Bell Tolls is next. This song has the best bass on the cd. All of the other songs on this cd are very good, especially Creeping Death, which I feel is the only song on here that could be held at the Puppets level. We can't forget at the end of the cd Cliff Burton's Call of the Ktulu, the greatest of the Metallica instrumentals. This is a very solid album, all the songs are at least 3.5/5 stars. My least favorite is Escape, but it is still a very solid track. The difference between this Metallica album and the next one is that this one (other than the first 2 tracks) lacks the sheer knockdown power of Puppets. I don't mean this one won't make you want to go on a headbanging rampage, I just mean it doesn't have enough effect to be labeled a classic like Puppets, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. Overall, very solid album, a must have for any metalhead.\",\n",
       " 293: \"I started to get into the whole Metallica thing a little under a decade ago. Then I entered into many phases; latin pop, christian and country; rap; hip hop etc. WEll, it is 2006 and I have circled back to where I began - Metallica and metal thrash. I must say that this CD is a very amazing foray into political disagreement with manyt hings - fear of death ( of many forms ) and death.  First of all, I don't know what a riff is. But I do know good music and good ' let's get going ' music and this is it. So that being said, let's begin shall we?\\n\\nFight Fire With Fire - Starts off with a nice little movement and then the drums start. Here is a song about how nuclear warfare will destroy us all if we fight fire with fire aka ' eye for eye tooth for tooth '. I must say, it is an enjoyable and exciting thrill ride. This is the perfect song to get someone pumped up, the devilish laugh is to show HE is winning not any of us. Fantastic joy ride. 10 / 10\\n\\nRide the Lightning - Holy freaking cow. I must say that this song starts off right off the bat as quick and pounding. A little past the midway point comes the amazing solo. This is a song speaking about the fear of dying in the electric chair, obviously, as the name of the song and cd and the pic on the cover indicate. Obviously, the way I see it, they are not coming out for or against they merely are singing about fear of dying in such a way. However we interpret that so be it. The solo is amazing and the song keeps you going at a fast pace. 10 / 10\\n\\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls - I don't know where this lovecraft thing came from. This is obviously a reference to Heminway's classic of the same title speaking about the spanish civil war - just like the book. The church bells and the guitar start off ominously. It's a little slower but just as aggressive as the first two. This is the type of song that can be played in many different settings and is definitely a concert song. Once the song transitions from the initial segments to the middle you can tell it's going to be a great song that will keep you thinking. Yep you THINK listening to Metallica ) for those who say metal damages the brain HA! ) 10 / 10\\n\\nFade to Black - Suicide. Suicidal thoughts. This is a fine ballad given these things however. I must say it is a great way to slow down after the first 3 pounding songs. It is a song, simply stated, about contemplating suicide and ' fading to black ' ending the life. I can see this song with many montagues in movies although they might have to loop the beginning and forego the lyrics which btw are standout. Just make sure you don't listen to the song while depressed. Int he right mood - THIS is the best song on the cd. In the wrong mood ( or a bad mood ) it's well.... 10 / 10\\n\\nTrapped Under Ice - Fear of being trapped under ice and screaming without anyone to hear you is definitely a few some people have. And in fact, the movies go a long way in showing the agony and fear as, like in space, no one can hear you scream under ice. The song is back to fast paced and typical thrash. I tend to not like this song as much as many on here. It seems to just drag on although the drumbs pounding are well. Lead singer's voice seems raspy here ( but it usuallyd oes 0 it just feels raspier.  8 / 10\\n\\nEscape - Yep, this is a filler and it is the worst song on the cd. However, it is definitely something that people can remember. I even sung part of this song in the shower so I know it can stay in the head. However, once you move onto the next track, it does feel like ' what did I just listen to? ' hits you. However it does have a classic ' 80's ' feel to it and that, for nostalgia sake if anything else, makes the song decent 7.5 / 10\\n\\nCreeping Death - Ah here we go. This song is fast paced with amazing 'rifs ' ( WHAT ARE THESE THINGS! ) and memorable lyrics. It is a little ominous with ' ooo death is coming ' and if you listen to this song at night with the lights off but candles glowing it's going to be a little too much in terms of the imagination department. One thing that separates this song fromt he others are the transitions ( are those rifs?! ) which, while exercising, keeps you going more than any other song. This is the perfect song to get someone jacked up before a big event. 8.5 / 10\\n\\nCall of Ktulu - Instrumental. Swoosh swoosh and guitar initially. Then the song transitions. You all know the song, it's been stated many times. There is one thing that tends to make the song memorable, it just SOUNDS like someone is traveling through something ( a forest, space, consciousness what have you ) and that feeling seems to make it all the more thrilling. After it switches to a little louder it just feels Metallicaish. Highly recommend for those with a great imagination feeling as if they are ' traveling '. 10 / 10\",\n",

Don't be fooled by it; no early-era Metallica tune lasts this way for long.

       " 304: \"Ride the Lightning is definetly one of Metallica's best albums.  It's definately better thought out than KILL 'EM ALL (not that I have a problem with it or anything). I don't think it is better than Puppets, but I think it deserves more credit that it is now receiving. This is how the album breaks down:\\n\\n 1. FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE: It starts off with a slow, acoustic\\n\\n  riff, but don't let that fool you, because it turnes into a\\n\\n  fast heavy metal riff. I think that this's the best track on\\n\\n  the album, but it's a close call 'cause there are other great\\n\\n  songs like FADE TO BLACK and CREEPING DEATH. I give it *****\\n\\n  stars.\\n\\n2. RIDE THE LIGHTNING: I like this song for many different\\n\\n  reasons. One, because it has a great riff. Two, because it\\n\\n  goes from fast to slow to fast to slow (it is very catchy).\\n\\n  Three, because the lyrics to this song are very well written\\n\\n  and very catchy. And four, because it has an awesome solo\\n\\n  somewhere in the middle. I give this song ***** stars.\\n\\n3. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS: Cool song but not much to talk about\\n\\n  here. Although, the riff is pretty sweet. I give **** stars.\\n\\n4. FADE TO BLACK: I love this song so much. Fade to Black is the\\n\\n  ballad of this album, and a hell good one too. The lyrics are\\n\\n  pretty good, but it's the guitar riffs that are really\\n\\n  amazing. The closing solo is one of the best I've ever heard.\\n\\n  I give this song ***** Stars.\\n\\n5. TRAPPED UNDER ICE: Nothin' much to say about this song. The\\n\\n  guitar work is average, same with the riffs. What really gets\\n\\n  me is the lyrics. It talks about dying while your, well,\\n\\n  trapped under ice. All in all, it's an alright song and\\n\\n  deserves **** stars.\\n\\n6. ESCAPE: Uh, this is, in my opinion, the weakest song on the\\n\\n  album. I have tried numerous times to like it, but it just\\n\\n  doesn't catch my attention like other songs. But hey, anything\\n\\n  is better than that damn St. Anger crap, so i'll give it ***\\n\\n  stars.\\n\\n7. CREEPING DEATH: Ah, now this is a song worthy of recognition.\\n\\n  This is where true metal is at its best. This song has the\\n\\n  freakin' coolest riff ever! The lyrics and the vocals by James\\n\\n  are exellent, Lars shows what he's made of by dishing out some\\n\\n  pretty neat drumwork, and Cliff, as always, is superb on bass.\\n\\n  This song is definatley worthy of five stars. ***** stars.\\n\\n8. THE CALL OF KTULU: This instrumental is definately one of the\\n\\n  best instrumentals METALLICA dishes out. The guitar sounds\\n\\n  pretty cool in the begining, but gets better as the song\\n\\n  progresses. Lars does a good job on the drums in my opinion.\\n\\n  My two favorite instrumentals are Call of KTULU, and Orion, on\\n\\n  the Puppets album. This instrumental desrves ***** stars.\\n\\n If you have not yet been introduced to the world of METALLICA, then I don't really recommend this album to you. I would recommend MASTER OF PUPPETS or KILL 'EM ALL. But if you have already been exposed to the radiation of Metallica, then this album would be perfect for you.\",\n",
       " 305: \"Ride the Lightning -- one of two of the heaviest Tallica albums (the other being Puppets) that has actual influences coming from the bassist, Cliff Burton who was classically trained. In fact, musical theory classes at the University of Colorado analyze For Whom the Bell Tolls. The songs are more classically complex rather than merely utilizing classical chord progressions.\\n\\nThis album is 7/8ths perfect: Trapped Under Ice is regarded by the band as filler.  However much I hate to agree, I listen to this album straight through every time.\\n\\nListening to Ride the Lightning is like taking a weather course.  The band throws you fire, lightning, death, night, ice water, air, earth, and a digression into mythology.  As a whole, Metallica's albums can be classified as chrysology: the study of precious metal.\\n\\nI was in France when I purchased my first Metallica album, in 1991. I almost bought Lightning simply because it had the coolest artwork on the cover, but I ended up going with the Black album (best 149 Francs I ever spent!). I don't think I could've appreciated this album back then as I do now.\",\n",
       " 306: \"This is one of Metallica's best and probably falls just a little short to ...And Justice For All.  The opener starts off sorta slow and builds up to be a sorta fly-bye song.  Fight Fire With Fire is personally not my favorite song on the album.  It's the worst for me.  But it's still really good.  The sound is just not for me.  The next track is one of my favorites of all time.  Its starts off fast and ends fast.  This is of course Ride The Lightning.  Its the 2nd best song on the album.  I know you know the best song.  Its coming up.  The next track is called For Whom The Bell Tolls.  This is a live favorite.  It starts off with ringing of bells and serious distorted guitars.  The drums come in strong.  The song ends by fading out. Its pretty good.  The best song has finally arrived.  It is of course Fade To Black.  This is probably my 2nd fav song of all of songs in metallica history.  My fav of all time is One.  I find this song very sad but in a good way.  The guitar riff is amazing.  It starts off slow and mid-way, you hear bursting-loud guitars.  By the end its fading out while a solo is going on.  I think this is one of the worst endings in history.  Come on, I mean.. why not just finish the solo and end or fade out with the drums leading.  That makes more sense to me.  But this ending went down in history, and cant change it, so be happy about it.  The lyrics are the best on the album.  Anyone who doesn't agree is crazy.  The next song is Trapped Under Ice.  It opens up strong.  And stays strong.  The solo is amazing.  It ends with a final drum beat.  The next song is called Escape.  I read other reviews and noticed that people thought this was easily the worst song.  I beg to differ.  I really think this song is good.  Its better then anything off of the later albums, not saying they were bad albums.[ By the way, i'm gonna post reviews for every metallica album asap]  Escape has good guitar parts in it.  It has a sorta poppy metal sound to it.  The next song is about a time in our world history (so they say) when god or jesus sent that big disease sorta like thing and kill all new born babies.  I don't read the bible so wouldn't know exactly.  From this perspective.. the song doesn't make much sense to me.  I still think its a great song.  The guitars are great in this one.  The final song is called The Call of Ktulu.  Not much to say about this one.  Its an instrumental.  I would rate this one lower then Fight Fire With Fire, but the guitars are quite awesome.  I just don't like instrumentals.\\n\\n****** overall, i would give this album 10 out of 10 stars.  Its quite the album and beats Megadeth's Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good.... I will post that review asap.  I can tell you right now.. if your debating whether to go for Metallica or Megadeth.. I got a solution.  Metallica's 80s' albums surpasses Megadeth's 80s' album by just a tad... but when it comes to the 90s', Megadeth takes the lead.  I hope this helps in more than one way.  Would highly appreciate a good 'helpful or not' decision.\",\n",
       " 307: \"When I first started listening to Metallica, I worked backward from their best stuff.  I got the Black Album and absolutely loved it, then ...And Justice for All made me want more, and Master of Puppets became my favorite album. When I got Ride the Lightning, I had found a new favorite. This album kicks ass.\\n\\nRTL starts off with Fight Fire with Fire, pure speed metal and rage that will send a chill down your spine. RTL's title track picks up where Fight... left off with 6 1/2 minutes of hardcore metal. The best song on the CD and my favorite Metallica song ever is For Whom the Bell Tolls. The bass (yes bass!) to open this song is phenomenal, and one can only wonder exactly how good Metallica would have been if Cliff Burton had not died in November 1986, God rest his metal soul. For Whom the Bell Tolls still brings a tear to my eye as I headbang to the awesome guitar and drums. The rest of the tracks are equally metal, and although Fade to Black might fool you at the beginning, it gets fast and heavy at the end. Even the instrumental Call of Ktulu is a killer song, and there is not one sour note played on any of the tracks.\\n\\nOverall I give this album a 10 out of 10. It is perfect, and a must have for anyone who considers themselves a metal fan. Pick this one up!\",\n",
       " 308: 'If Metallica\\'s 1983 \"Kill \\'Em All\" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release \"Ride The Lightning\" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since \"Kill \\'Em All\", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren\\'t the only improvement. Hetfield\\'s lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from \"Kill \\'Em All\" out of the water. Tracks such as \"Fade To Black\" and \"The Call of Ktulu\" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it\\'s up for debate, Hammett\\'s guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on \"Ride The Lightning\", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include \"Fight Fire with Fire,\" and \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\". This album rocks in epic proportions.\\n\\nOverall, Metallica ruled the world at this point in time. There was no limits to their re-invention of raw, hardcore thrash metal. I was a huge Metallica fan growing up, and this one got spun the most. This is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a Metallica fan.',\n",

       " 312: 'Ride The Lightning is Metallica\\'s second album.  This is where you begin to see the maturing in their song writing, and album writing as a whole.  The songs are a lot more atmospheric and interesting.  Listen to the lead riff in \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\", also note their first ballad \"Fade To Black\", lastly, let\\'s not forget their first instrumental, The Call Of Ktulu, it\\'s these elements that make Ride The Lightning more interesting and entertaining to the listener.  Production seems a little better than Kill Em All, and Hetfield is starting to find his singing voice a little better.  Musically, this is probably their heaviest album.  The lyrics are as great as they\\'ve always been with Metallica.  This is the first sign that there was more to Metallica than just lightning speed thrash band.  Highly recommended.',\n",
       " 313: 'The main reason I only rated this album at 4 stars was that in my opinion it is not as consistent as some of Metallica\\'s other records. There is quite a mix of material, ranging in my opinion from the sub-standard to the excellent. The album has a very morbid theme to it, with each song revolving around the topic of death. There are a couple of songs that stand out way above the rest, namely For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade To Black.\\n\\n The opening track, Fight Fire With Fire, has a slow intro before breaking into one of Metallica\\'s fastest ever songs. This attack on nuclear warfare is, in my opinion, the worst song on the album and receives just four out of ten from me. Hetfields vocals are poor and the song is dull.\\n\\n The title track, Ride The Lightning, focuses on the electric chair. The song is quite good, with a good guitar solo. Hetfield screams a bit too much. Six out of ten.\\n\\n For Whom The Bell Tolls, on the other hand, is one of Metallica\\'s greatest ever songs. Hammett\\'s fast guitar riff is brilliant, as are Hetfield\\'s vocals. The lyrics are also great and convey a very clear message about war. The song\\'s main downfall is that it only has two verses and a short chorus. There are two minutes of music before the vocals start, and before you know it the main part of the song is over, and the fade-out is just a dull, repetitive racket that lasts for ages. Nevertheless, the brilliant lyrics, vocals and guitar-work earn the song an overall nine out of ten from me.\\n\\n Track four, Fade To Black, contends closely with One for the title of \\'Metallica\\'s greatest song\\' in my opinion. A brilliant, soft intro, soft, moving verses (on the topic of suicide), and and a massive guitar solo lasting several minutes until the fade-out. The one thing I would change would be to add more vocals - they\\'re the best part of the song. At least ten out of ten.\\n\\n Trapped Under Ice: good bit in the middle. Otherwise sub-standard - five out of ten. I will say no more.\\n\\n Escape, despite being short (by Metallica standards - less than four minutes I think) has quite good verses and a very good chorus. The riff is great ... seven out of ten.\\n\\n Ride The Lightning\\'s penultimate track, Creeping Death, has a biblical theme, centred around the book of Exodus. Great verses, brilliant chorus. Magnificent guitar solo. Then there\\'s the part, \"Die, by my hand, I creep across the land, killing first-born man\" which should always be played as loud as you possibly can without the neighbours taking you to court. Out of ten, I\\'ll give it nine.\\n\\n The Call Of Ktulu (can anyone tell me what the Ktulu is supposed to be?) is a brilliant instrumental - great end to the album. It starts off soft, with an eerie sound, before breaking into a great, heavy riff that won\\'t leave your head for days. Nine out of ten would probably be my rating. Don\\'t let the filler put you off - this album is worth ordering just for the best few songs alone.',\n",

       " 319: 'Even though Metallica didn\\'t truly break out and become mainstream until 1991\\'s self-titled \\'Black Album\\', of their early albums, this actually is the closest in sound to that one, but a little darker and heavier. Yes, it\\'s thrash and has a bit of headbanger appeal, but it\\'s more commercial than it gets credit for, as well, but not in a wimping out or poppy way.\\n1. Fight Fire With Fire -- The soft accoustic intro explodes (literally) into an anti-nuclear war speed metal headbanger. It\\'s mostly got a thrash pace, but has a nice solo toward the end. It\\'s still listenable, but not really one of my favorites. Not recommended for more pop/commercial oriented fans.\\n2. The title track is similar, but with more variation (aka better). Told from the point of view of a prison inmate on the electric chair, and also anti-death. A bit more anthemic, especially on the chorus and the bridge. It also features a long, fast, unforgettable solo. Had this come out 7+ years later, it could\\'ve been big.\\n3. For Whom The Bell Tolls -- The first of the now famous songs, a somewhat mid tempo, more commercial oriented metal anthem. This time, the theme is soldiers at war. Again, it\\'s not wimping out at all, but it could appeal to metalheads as well as 80\\'s AOR rock fans. Despite its \\'hit\\' status today, it\\'s still criminally underrated, one of their best.\\n4. Fade to Black -- Their very first noticeable change of pace and semi hit. This heavy, somewhat sensitive rocking ballad is often rumored to be about encouraging suicide, but, according to the band, it is not. It starts off slow but builds up to a medium \\'rocker\\' about midway through. Somewhat dark yet happy, at strange as that sounds. One of their best songs. Why isn\\'t this bigger than their \\'96-present cr*p!?\\n5. Trapped Under Ice -- A theme of being stuck under a block of ice and not being able to escape. Not too memorable, but not bad. Again, much more of a thrashy pace with several blazing solos.\\n6. Escape -- If there was a third commercial type song here, this would be it. It seems to be the least liked of the 8 tracks here, but I\\'ll never know why. A bit more anthemic, particularly on the slower sung chorus, it\\'s also lyrically the \\'lightest\\', not dealing with death of any kind, but just being about finding peace with yourself and escaping. Hence the title, I guess.\\n7. Creeping Death -- The pace increases yet again with the Egyptian tale of pharoes and slaves\\' death. A definite thrasher but remains unique enough with its slightly exotic solo (in keeping with the theme, I suppose). Has become a concert favorite, with its \"Die, die, die, die!\" chant.\\n8. Call of the Ktulu -- A medium paced (for them) 9 minute guitar instumental with a darker sound. Since one of the things I love about music is words, I usually don\\'t care as much for instrumentals, but I have to say, this one\\'s pretty good. Still, it\\'s the one I listen to the least.\\nBasically, headbangers - don\\'t be turned off by the 2 (almost 3) now commercial tunes, there\\'s plenty you\\'ll love here. Mainstream rock/newer Metallica fans - you\\'ll soon discover more than you thought you\\'d like here. Buried beneath the loud noise and screaming, it\\'s very catchy and not as scary as it would appear on first listen.\\nCheck my music reviews. I\\'m mostly into 80s rock (with quite a bit of classic rock, pop, and some 90s pop/rock). Most of the people reading this will probably laugh at some of the stuff I listen to - and heh, I invite you to (Loverboy, Phil Collins, Lionel Richie, Poison, Green Day, Gin Blossoms, Avril Lavigne, Rod Stewart, Eagles, etc).\\nWhoa, you guys still with me, or did you already vote \\'not helpful\\'?

Very few bands are able to show such a wide range of talents on a particular album, but you can see the band going through phases seeminly right before your eyes.  The brutal Fight Fire With Fire opens with the comically soft intro, while Ride The Lightning tackles tough emotion with a beautifully crafted epic piece.  Fade To Black...I think nearly everyone had heard it and knows of its greatness.  A lot of people agree with me when they say that Escape is one of Metallica's most underrated songs, along with Trapped Under Ice.  Perhaps they are a victim of being stashed on a CD with other classics like Fade and For Whom The Bell Tolls - but you will love these songs just as much - if not more.

       " 330: \"I bought this album during the middle of the whole Metallica vs. the Internet ordeal. I was on the Internet's side, and I wasn't kicked off or anyhting, but my computer's sound card got [goofed] up, and I couldn't hear the songs I got anymore anyway. So, me being me, I decided to give Metallica a go, and bought this album out of random.\\n I got it, put it in the CD player, and sat back (a musical tradition with my family-always listen to an album all the way through, only skipping if it is a bad song...it's my tradition, at least). I heard the few opening seconds and noticed that it wasn't thashing out of my speakers...wait...BOOM. I found myself air-drumming with the song, and realized that I had been brought into this monster called Metallica...and enjoyed it. The title track took me to my uncle's position, and For Whom The Bell Tolls is a ... great tune, spaced-out solo at the end. Fade To Black was a sudden mood change compared to it's predecessors on the album, ... great tune either way you look at it, my personal favorite off of the album. The next 2 songs were great, and the album's closing 2 are some of the best 14+ minutes in rock that I can think of.\\n All in all, the album changed my mind about Metallica, and it can you too, unless you buy one of the LOADs first, then it's too late. So, if you think you can handle Metallica (and everything that comes with it), buy this album as a starter kit, and see what you think.\",\n",
       " 331: \"Ride the Lightning marks the begining of a somewhat Progressive era in Metallica's career that would last for the next two Albumns. Every song Hits you like a ton of Bricks. James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich came into their own as songwriters on this CD,They went in a diffrent direction without selling out. (they waited a few years to do that)The only thing that keeps me from giving this CD 5 stars is the fact that it only has 8 songs. But Thats the only bad point ...If you like heavy Metal you will love this CD......I do.\",\n",
       " 332: 'I have the very original release of the LP on the metal indie Megaforce, released just before Elektra here signed them and reissued the LP only a few months later, making the Megaforce original a collector\\'s item.  Just total kick@$s metal all the way! The bonus CD could be \"Jump in the Fire\", but I aine sure.  On Vertigo or Sony (Japan).',\n",
       " 333: \"This is one of the best albums in the history of music.  Not just metal, ALL music.  From the comparably light classic guitar intro to Fight Fire with Fire to the grandiose drum crashing end to Call of Ktulu, this album  shows Metallica's full range of musical composition, speed guitaring,  growling lyrical genius, and an impressive array of concepts.  The title  track is a fast and aggressive look at an electric-chair execution,  complete with the plaintive moans of 'I don't want to die'.  For Whom the  Bell Tolls shares billing with One (of the later released Justice album) as  Metallica's best song, and moves you from its opening of Church bells to  the drum solo at the end.  Fade to Black, a  slower and more soulful song  about suicide and depression, is one of the band's best, and shows Kirk's  full guitar ability.  Trapped Under Ice and Escape are comparatively weak,  but are still solid metal songs, if not good ones that are merely under  rated.  Creeping Death however, is amazing.  Taken from the Hebrew story  about the final plague in Egypt, its pure adrenaline pumping sound has made  it a crowd favorite for years.  The die die chant between the 2nd and final  verses truly makes the blood flow.  The album closes with a powerful and  intriguing instrumental, The Call of Ktulu.  Many don't give this song its  due for its complexity and the adrenaline rush it can give as it shifts  gears from a low octane opening, to a speedy heart, and ending in a series  of cymbol crashes and power cords.  All in all, worth buying for any price,  and a must own for any metal fan.\",\n",
       " 334: \"This is a great album. It combines the speed metal style of Kill em'All with flawless and drown out guitar riffs to create something totally original. Every song is a gem. Escape is the only weaker track. It's still  good though. The intro to Fight Fire with Fire is similar to some of the  great Led Zeppelin intros. For Whom the Bell Tolls is perhaps the best  example of Cliff Burton's genius. Call of Ktulu is a masterpeice with or  without the Symphony. Buy this CD, you want regret it.\",\n",

Metallica is one of the groups that can evolve and they've always been doing so -  this album was as radical a departure (or shift in course) as they've  managed to pull off every time they issue a new one. Old timers like myself  would love to hear a follow up to what I consider to be their top (Master  Of Puppets & And Justice For All) but this is the way it is. They'd  probably go insane from doing the same thing endlessly in the studio as  many seem to feel disappointed about them not doing. This is definitely  worth the money.\",\n",

I know many metallifans are skeptical about purchasing these re-masters, but to my ears, the superior sound quality is there and is noticeable. I have owned a recording of this album (Ride the  Lightning) on either record or cd since 1984, and have heard it probably a  million times since then. When I heard the remastered cd version today, I  heard many things that I hadn\\'t heard before. For example: The clarity in  the intro solo by Hammett on \"Fade to Black, the way Cliff Burton\\'s  roaring, howling lead bass was meant to stand out on \"The Call of  Ktulu\", crisper drums and background vocals on \"Creeping  Death\" and \"Trapped Under Ice\" are just some of the many  sonic improvements on this cd. I understand that it\\'s a lot of  money for a cd that most people who are fans of the band already own. But  if you are a long time or serious fan/collector, this is a true must have.  If you are on a tight budget, or think the standard cd sounds good enough,  don\\'t bother. The cd also features re-packaging just like the original  album (right down to the original megaforce records label in the upper  right hand side of the back cover), though the differences are minimal from  the standard issue cd, but noteworthy to the serious fan. I can only hope  and pray that the horrendously recorded \"And Justice For All\"  receives a similar treatment in the very near future.',\n",

Nothing Else Matters  made it so hard to choose, but it came down to the fact that Fade to Black,  For Whom the Bell Tolls, Creeping Death, and the awesomest instrumental of  all time, The Call of Ktulu are present on Ride the Lightning.

Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it\\'s arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate\\'s world-class vocals. This is possibly the band\\'s best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it\\'s conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department.

For the non-footballers among you, that is, as direct free kicks go, fairly unthreatening. The defence composes a salutary \"wall\" to block a direct shot and the attacking players assemble in the penalty box to receive a crossed kick.\\nDead-ball specialist Beckham trots up - this is genuinely the last chance saloon, remember - and languidly strikes the ball, aiming outside and over the wall. It seems to be heading harmlessly into touch, thinks the goalkeeper, who watches in horror and awe, rooted to the spot, as the football defies the known laws of physics, prescribes a ridiculously tight arc, curling vicously and dipping at the last minute and sneaks into the top left hand corner of the goal. Utterly sublime.\\nThat is how good this record is, and it was created out of just such an unlikely situation. Late 90s Britain believed, vainly, that \"Cool Britannia\" - a hastily thrown together political slogan - was the answer to everything. All the while pop music became more vacuous, more manufactured and less appealing. \"Alternative\" music had developed into hackneyed synth-fests of any interest to those (and there were many) blitzed out of their eyeballs on e, and nobody had much musically or artistically to say. Massive Attack, which had scored a number of well attended but not earth shattering albums through the \\'90s released this.\\nNot just cleverly sampled breakbeats - but melodies. Not just melodies, but haunting melodies. Not just haunting melodies, but menace. Not just menace, but grinding, howling guitars (long a taboo on \"dance\" records). And then groove.\\nYes, it\\'s dark - it\\'s brooding, but boy is it beautiful. All cliche is excised and conventions are instead subverted and inverted. It\\'s genuinely massive.\\nAnd then, like the English football team in Korea Japan 2002, it all came apart, wheels fell off and everyone went their separate ways.\\nBut what a SCREAMER of a goal it was, though.',\n",

Most definetly (I've listened to so much music in my lifetime that I could name one from each genre, so I'm not classic-rock biased---I wouldn't write if I were). Mezzanine? Sorry, not quite. I certainly agree that some of the sounds that Massive Attack incorporated into their work are intriguing and original, and Teardrop in particular is a very soothing song---however, my nephew's Bedtime Music for Kids CD is also soothing, but it's not a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's total sludge, in fact I've heard much worse. Unfortunately, however, I bought the CD on the basis of what other reviews have said about it, and from the gushing remarks, I was expecting God to come wafting out of my speakers. Judging by the lonely way my copy of Mezzanine is floating among friends in an attempt to find a home, that didn't happen, and this will probably be the last time I'll be so adventurous when buying music.

Well, sink me if that isn't what he did! I think one problem with Wild  Life, though, is that Paul was still a bit down in the dumps about his  still-recent divorce from the other three lads, and with Lennon taking  potshots at him in the press along with the lackluster reception for  Ram...well, even the normally bubbly Macca's self confidence must have been  running a bit low. The uncertainty is a bit palpable all over Wild Life;  Mumbo, for example, might have been a scorching rocker if Paulie had been  bothered to write some lyrics and do a couple more takes; Dear Friend is a  conflicted counter-attack on Mr. Ono Lennon without a whole lot of  conviction; Paul comes across as hesitant to really let loose on his  erstwhile bandmate. Bip Bop...well, let's just say it lives up to it's  title...I must admit at odd times, usually when in my cups, I'll go around  humming its absurdly catchy tune. Lyrics? well,they're better than the ones  for Mumbo...I'll let it go at that. OK, I'm being a bit snide, I  know...there is some good stuff here; I really like Tomorrow, with those  nice, echoey BV's from the McCartneys that used to be a highlight (to me,  anyway) of Paul's pre-Venus And Mars output; the cover of Love Is Strange  is...well, lovely but strange. Some People Never Know has a pretty melody,  but Linda was just a little too much up front in the mix...again, some  second takes might have helped here. Really, to me, only the painfully flat  I Am Your Singer is unlistenable. Do I recommend you spend your hard earned  cash on Wings Wild Life? Well, be forewarned that only the staunchest  Beatlefans (of which yours truly counts himself amongst same) will really  enjoy it. This was definitely one of Mr. Mc's valleys,and the curious buyer  should take this into consideration. It becomes a better bargain, though,  if this import version has the same bonus tracks as the US release several  years ago (the nice folks at Amazon.com didn't provide a track listing for  this release)...I've always had a soft spot for his covert f-you to his  critics Mary Had A Little Lamb, and its B-side Little Woman Love is a  rollicking number that would have improved Wild Life considerably.

The absolute low point is Love is Strange. The one  redeeming moment is McCartney's response to How Do YOu Sleep?. Dear Friend  answers Lennon with a touch of compassion, but with an undercurrent of  sarcasm every bit as cutting as Lennon's.\",\n",

This brilliant young man has composed all this. I can hear his emotions and how much work he has put onto this. I think that Malmsteen created this because he was finally trying to manifest his true desire. I think he should ditch his whole metal type of music and concentrate on this.

To sum up this cd, It's a compilation of copied phrases from real composers with improvised fillers. For what it is, it's a neat gimmick, but not real classical music. Yngwie is a excellent rock electric guitar improviser, but for himself to pose as a classical composer is a insult to classical music. As for the playing itself. Yngwie does a decent job, but if we are to compare him to the best classical musicians, this sounds sloppy with no dynamics.

Unfortunately, it doesn't actually tell the whole story, and degenerates into cheesiness typical of '80s-era art rock.  It starts off with one of it's less-cheesy songs, I Am the One You Warned Me Of, but gets cheesier and cheesier from there.  The album does provide an interesting alternative realization of Astronomy (the climactic song on Secret Treaties), which was the one song I did add to my iTunes library.  The song Blue Oyster Cult was an alternative take on the Secret Treaties song Subhuman, also not one of the worst songs on the album.  However, the cheesiest song of all is the last song on the album, also the album's title song, and should be climactic, not an homage to 80's schlock; it reminds me of the theme song to the John Carpenter film Big Trouble in Little China, which played over the end credits of that film.  Of course, taste is an individual thing, and I could be trashing songs that others enjoy a lot.  In that spirit, I'd like to say that if you liked 70's and 80's art rock concept albums, like the Edgar Allan Poe Tales of Mystery and the Imagination album by the Alan Parsons Project (which is the best example I can give of an album similar to this one), you may well like this album.  Alternately, if you'd like to explore Blue Oyster Cult truly at their best, obtain and listen to their first three albums (Blue Oyster Cult, Tyranny and Mutation, and Secret Treaties) in order, and then you will get a sense of what I'd hope this album would be.\",\n",

I\\'ve seen many online comments about how great it is, and how much money the original CD has brought in online auctions. So, when this reissue was released, I had to pick it up. Well...it really doesn\\'t do it for me, I\\'m afraid. The problem is that, first of all, it doesn\\'t sound like a BOC album, and, as I recently discovered, it isn\\'t. It\\'s a solo album by BOC\\'s drummer, Albert Bouchard, and seems to be an attempt at a \"rock opera\". Despite the efforts of musicians such as Joe Satriani and Robbie Krieger, the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another. The rather pointless re-do of \"Astronomy\" seems to indicate that there wasn\\'t enough material to work with. And if you\\'re going to call this a BOC album, you\\'ve gotta have Buck Dharma, who gets short shrift here. The word is that the record company insisted that IMAGINOS be released as a Blue Oyster Cult album, apparently realizing that this material wasn\\'t going to be too saleable on its own. The album is not a total disaster (I kind of like the Baron Frankenstein number), but I\\'m very glad that I didn\\'t pay $100.00 for it on eBay!

Come on now, we all know a group has  had it when they start re-recording their own songs(usually means they  can't write quality new ones).The reason they give for this is that they  were a part of some great lost conceptualized work that the record label  wouldn't let them do way back when(yeah, yeah,yeah). From what I'm told  this was originally supposed to be an Albert Bouchard solo album, hence the  million guests guitarists. That brings up another point, with a great  guitarist like Roeser, why did you need any of those guys(Satriani, Aldo  Nova, Robby Krieger[and what exactly did they do anyway])The label probably  made them call it a BOC album, or they wouldn't have let it come out.

That would just waste my time and yours, since you\\'ve already decided that you have an interest in this edited CD.\\nSo here\\'s the lowdown.  This clean version of \"The Slim Shady LP\" does a lot of things wrong.  The most obvious problem is the editing method used.  Instead of dubbing words out, which is the least one ought to expect, they simply scramble/reverse the audio.  Not just the vocals, either - the ENTIRE audio section gets altered.  Taking out words is one thing, but when the entire beat and instrumental track gets scrambled, it kills the flow of the song.  In \"Guity Conscience\" they also use this awful \"scratching\" effect on top of the audio - and I don\\'t mean hip-hoppy turntable scratching, I mean a literal, unpleasant SCRATCHING noise that would make you think you had a defective CD or something.  At other points on the album, the production gets even lazier as portions of the songs are actually SILENCED.  As in no vocals, no backing instremental, no audio.  Nothing but a blank space.\\nThe second problem comes with the language they choose to edit.  In most cases, edited versions are produced in order to remove curse words.  On this disc, it\\'s only the \"F-word\" that gets taken out, so you\\'ll still be hearing \"sh--\" quite a bit.  I\\'m not gonna get into a debate about appropriate language, but making an edited CD that you still wouldn\\'t be able to play on radio seems rather pointless.\\nMost annoying of all, however, is what DOES get edited on this CD.  Every drug reference gets scrambled, which is somewhat understandable, but still frustrating in many cases.  But then they go and remove \"violent\" lyrics, and this is where things get out of hand.  Words like \"die,\" \"kill,\" and \"shoot\" are all removed.  Case in point - in \"Brain Damage,\" there\\'s a line about schoolyard bullies roughing up Eminem as a child.  Eminem quotes these bullies as saying \"You\\'re gonna die!\" but the word \"die\" is scrambled.  Elsewhere on the disc, a narrator describes \"the legend of Slim Shady\" in a parody of Westerns, and relates the tale of how Slim was \"shot in the back.\"  The word \"shot\" is edited.  Half of these edits are things you can say in G-rated movies.  Taking out curse words is one thing, but what they do to this disc insults the basic intelligence of the listener.  It\\'s especially silly in a song like \"Role Model,\" where the message of the entire song is how Eminem is NOT a role model, and how no one with a brain should do anything he describes.\\nYou can see the irony here; \"sh-t\" is left in while \"shoot\" gets scrambled.  Only \"Just Don\\'t Give\" has been resonably edited, and that\\'s only because the song had previously been edited when it was released as a single.  This CD is un unlistenable mess; and even if you\\'re willing to tolerate some \"choppiness\" in order to get a \"clean\" version, you\\'ll be disappointed on that front as well.  If you\\'re looking for a relatively clean Eminem CD, I\\'d recommend the edited version of \"The Eminem Show.\"  All the edits on THAT album are of professional quality, and they succeed in bringing all the language to a TV-PG level, while leaving most of Eminem\\'s wit intact.',\n",
       " 470: 'I am no doubt a big Eminem fan---I happen to own all of his albums. But I really think that the producers should\\'ve refrained from releasing \"clean\" versions of the album mainly because the songs lose its great rhythm. We all know that his lyrics are laden with unprintable expletives all over. So, expectedly, every other word is censored, and having all those short silent spaces or blurred sounds in between words are just so distracting and enough to give the listener a big headache.\\nAlso, some of Enimen\\'s witty humor is lost in the clean version. Perfect cases in point are that of \"My Name Is\" and \"Guilty Conscience.\" Try to listen both to the explicit and the clean versions and you\\'ll know what I mean.\\nIf you\\'re thinking of buying the Slim Shady LP, just buy the explicit version instead. If you\\'re too young and impressionable to buy it, then I suggest that you wait a few years until you\\'re old enough.

Over the years it has cemented its relatively obscure status because, despite its title, it has no songs about surfing and fast cars and because the title track features the gloriously impenetrable lyrics of Van Dyke Parks.\\n\\nIt was released in 1971, when the Beach Boys were at a commercial ebb and were in conflict over which direction the group should take. The band\\'s commercial influence was represented by Mike Love, Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston while its less pop oriented, artistically creative side was represented by Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson.\\n\\n\"Surf\\'s Up\" has no songs that will end up at the top of any list of the group\\'s most popular, but has several that more casual fans of the group should find extremely worthy. Among them are the title track, \"Don\\'t Go Near The Water\", \"Long Promised Road\", \"Feel Flows\", \"\\'Til I Die\", \"Surf\\'s Up\" and the oddly charming \"A Day In The Life Of A Tree\", which features a wavering lead vocal provided by Jack Rieley, the band\\'s manager.

       " 523: 'When I first heard this album on cassette back in the \\'90s, when I was still relatively new to the Beach Boys\\' music, I was struck by just how different it was from all the other stuff (most of it from the \\'60s) that I had heard by the group. (I was like, \"THIS is titled Surf\\'s Up?!\") When the album first came out in \\'71, it was something VERY apart from all that had come before (despite the title, which fooled me and has probably also fooled a lot of other people); in fact, there is STILL no other Beach Boys album quite like it. As I was to find out, there was a reason for the BIG difference between this album and the group\\'s previous efforts.\\nBy 1970, the Beach Boys\\' contract with Capitol had run out, and the group moved over to Warner Bros./Reprise. Their first album release after the move was the oh-so-gorgeous Sunflower. Unfortunately, by that time, the group\\'s popularity had taken a nosedive, as they had become regarded by the \"counterculture\" as \"square\" and \"unhip.\" The cultural and musical climates in America had changed, to put it mildly, and Sunflower was not a success. (It may sound like I\\'m confusing the Surf\\'s Up album with Sunflower here, but I\\'m not.) Heck, if a package of gum had had the words \"Beach Boys\" printed on it, it probably wouldn\\'t have sold. It was a very tragic fate for what I think is one of the group\\'s best albums, if not THE best one.\\nAfter this, fed up with being shunned by the \"hipsters,\" who had turned away from the bright, bouncy, good-timey stuff that they had been doing (or mostly been doing; there were exceptions, most notably on the Pet Sounds album), the Beach Boys resolved to shed their \"square\" image. As part of an effort to gain acceptance with the counterculture and reclaim their lost popularity, they put out Surf\\'s Up, which showed them heading in a new and \"hip\" direction (the ironic \"surf music\"-sounding title notwithstanding). That album was (and is) one of the most \"unique\" of the group\\'s albums, as it was (and is) more, well, \"serious\" than most of their other albums. Lo and behold, the group was singing about \"RELEVANT\" topics, like ecology and social and political upheaval! I really like this album, though I can see how some people may find it uncomfortable hearing the Beach Boys getting into such \"heavy\" territory. While the album may not be particularly harmony-rich overall (another thing that sets it apart from most of their other albums, including the failed Sunflower), it still has a lot of great vocals, and several really good songs.\\nOf the ten tracks, I consider half of them to be stand-outs: \"Long Promised Road,\" \"Disney Girls\" (which I think is the best song that Bruce Johnston wrote for the group), \"Feel Flows\" (although that one\\'s a little spooky-sounding!), \"Surf\\'s Up\" (which was originally written for the SMiLE album), and \"\\'Til I Die.\" The title track was \"cobbled together\" from several \"elements\": the \\'66-era backing track with a \\'71 lead vocal by Carl, which segues into Brian\\'s \\'66-era demo, which leads into a \\'71 rendition of the (also previously-unreleased-in-any-form) SMiLE song, \"Child Is Father Of The Man\"! \"\\'Til I Die\" has been described as Brian\\'s \"state of his world [at the time] address,\" and was reportedly described by at least one fellow Beach Boy as a \"downer.\" I\\'m glad the song made it onto the album, as it has some of the most beautiful harmonies that the group ever laid down, in my opinion.\\nI think the other tracks (or most of them) are good, too, some better than others, but not as good as the above tracks. A song like \"Don\\'t Go Near The Water\" being put out by the group who did \"Surfin\\' Safari,\" \"Surfin\\' U.S.A.,\" \"Catch A Wave,\" and all those other surfin\\' songs, not to mention \"Cool, Cool Water\" (a track from the Sunflower album)... I find that even more ironic than the album\\'s title! \"Take A Load Off Your Feet\" features some amusing \"effects.\" \"Student Demonstration Time\" (which was based on the Coasters song \"Riot In Cell Block #9\") is, to my ears, easily the most irritating track on the album. I think \"Lookin\\' At Tomorrow\" sounds good, but I\\'m not big on the storyline. I think that\\'s actually the group\\'s then-manager Jack Rieley doing the lead vocal on \"A Day In The Life Of A Tree.\"\\nWhile this album may have been a radical change of \"style\" for the group, it indeed helped them to regain their lost popularity (it reached the Top 30). It\\'s still a pretty strong album all these years later (in my opinion), although many fans (especially the ones who may only be familiar with the group\\'s \\'60s material) may find it difficult to imagine the Beach Boys doing an album like this.\\nTo my knowledge, this is the third time that the album has been reissued on CD; the first time was in 1990, and the second was in 2000 or so. I\\'ve never heard the \\'90 CD reissue, so I don\\'t really know how it sounded, but I CAN say that if you have the later reissue (which was coupled with Sunflower), you probably don\\'t really need to get this one, as I can\\'t tell that there is much if any difference in the sound quality (which I think sounds fine) between the two.',\n",

AR\\'s affair with barbara\\'s husband nathaniel (entered into openly and with the consent of both spouses and the focal point of the movie) does not even begin until page 259 of the 422 page book but the preceding and succeeding in depth discussion of ayn rand\\'s amazing journey from soviet russia to the USA to success as one of the great writers and philosophers of the 20th century is of only passing interest to the producers of this movie. sex and alleged psycho-pathology are all the producers of this movie are really interested in. i guess that is what they think will sell. the famous slapping scene when AR first confronts NB after finding out that he has been cheating not only on her but on barbara with one of his psychotherapy patients (whom the movie calls \"caroline\" even though her real name was patreecia), is intended to show AR as unreasonably unforgiving and vindictive. however, the producers in their zeal to do so, notably fail to show the viewer the many months of suspicion, deception and lies that preceded the ultimate revelation. during those months, as the book makes clear, AR agonized over vague \"problems\" in the AR/NB relationship and tried for hours on end to discuss the situation with NB to help him deal not only with their relationship but also with his relationship with barbara, which was likewise suffering at that time. yes,the book describes her slapping NB furiously and thereafter acting very vindictively against him, and a rational assessment of her actions might indeed find her to have over-reacted. but the  movie does a disservice to any such rational assessment by completely (and i would say deliberately) ignoring the many months during which AR invested so much of her psyche trying to help someone whom she mistakenly trusted with a \"problem\" about which he was being untruthful and deceptive. nor does the movie bother to emphasize the supreme importance of \"integrity\" to AR or nathan\\'s place in her life as a \"hero\" who embodied (she thought) her values. it simply makes no real effort to examine, one might say,  the righteousness of her indignation. the movie has a line where barbara asks AR to show \"compassion\" to nathan because \"that\\'s what people do.\" this line appears nowhere in the book and is just another example of the producers putting their own anti-rand agenda ahead of the very source material on which the movie has purportedly been based. although i suppose it has nothing to do with the above-described rand-bashing agenda, their contempt for the truth even goes so far as to make up a character named richard for barbara to become involved with!!!! i could cite other examples ad infinitum but will simply end by suggesting that rather than waste time watching this garbage, one might better spend one\\'s time reading the much more even-handed and respectful barbara branden book itself or, even better, watching the excellent documentary on vhs entitled \"ayn rand: a sense of life,\" which received an oscar nomination in the early 80\\'s. actually, one should not bother with any of the above prior to reading rand herself: atlas shrugged, the fountainhead, we the living, anthem, etc etc etc, all of which i strongly recommend. she was a great woman, the obvious opinion of the producers of this movie to the contrary notwithstanding.',\n",

Fortunately, Mr. Valliant's book, along with Marry Ann Sures'  _Facets of Ayn Rand_ ([...]) proved that Miss Rand was a far better person than represented by the Branden's books, and it was, in fact, the Brandens who were dishonest and manipulative.

By the age of nine, it is said that she knew she wanted to dedicate her life to writing and to philosophy.\\n\\nRussia of the times was focused in collectivism, something Ayn Rand despised. After reading the works of Victor Hugo her character starts to shape. She lived through the Kerensky Revolution and in 1917, through the Bolshevik Revolution. From the start, she denounced communism and when the revolutionaries are victorious and start the painstaking process of taking away property, confiscating the pharmacy her father owned, she decides Russia is not the country for her. The family undergoes poverty and lack of food. While at school, during a class of American History, Ayn develops the ardent desire to become an American citizen. The United States becomes her goal because she wants to join a nation of free men and women, where the rights of the individual are protected by its constitution.\\n\\nThe university where she was studying philosophy is overtaken by communists, but during her last years of study; she enjoys one great pleasure, watching Western films and plays, and decides to enter the State Institute for Cinema Arts to study screenwriting.\\n\\nFinally, she is permitted to leave Soviet Russia and to visit the United States. Her trip was supposed to last a short time, but she was determined never to return to Russia. New York City, with its skyscrapers, thousand lights, and never ending activity becomes the city that shapes her interpretation of the finest achievements of humanity.\\n\\nFor a while, following her acting career, she travels to Hollywood and meets Cecil B. DeMille, who offers this striking young woman, with piercing eyes, a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings. Mr. DeMille gives her an opportunity, her first job in the USA, as an extra, a script reader.\\n\\nShe meets actor Frank O\\'Connor and they strike interesting conversations that result in a marriage until death did they part. She writes The Fountainhead, where she shapes a hero by the name of Howard Roark, an architect, an ideal man that reveals to the world a philosopher that clearly sees how \"a man ought to be.\" She then moves to write Atlas Shrugged, a novel that shares her philosophy through a story, surfacing the concept of objectivism, or how to live on Planet Earth.\\n\\nPassion is not our favorite view to Ayn Rand. The DVD offers an interpretation of her affair to Nathaniel Branden, but to see how she relates to him and to his wife is sad and almost made us feel that she used her superior wit and intellect to shape these relationships into calculated displays of weak characters. We have always admired Ayn Rand and her marriage to Frank O\\'Connnor was all we knew about. If all the hypocrisy of this foursome was indeed true, then... as with any hero placed on a pedestal... we found that Ayn Rand did compromise, was unfaithful to her Frank, and was in the end... only human.

No John Galt, no superman (superwoman?), her very actions revealed the emptiness of Objectivism.\\nRand is the best-portrayed character, although the movie would have benefited from more of her background - the only hint of her past is a brief conversation at a wedding reception. There was a lot more to Ayn Rand than her philosophy and her libido, and the movie failed to show this. Breathing onto a NYC store window, she draws a dollar sign and proclaims it her emblem. Why is this? What personal experiences led Rand to develop this view? The movie leaves these important questions unanswered.\\nThe other characters seem one-dimensional, especially the angst-ridden, emotionally fragile narrator. The production of this movie, while okay for a made-for-cable show, leaves much to be desired.\\nPerhaps the most revealing scene is when Rand is asked, during a lecture, what \"love\" means to an Objectivist.

In fact, it's a night of mostly classic rock for baby boomers. I'm no youngster myself, but David Bowie opening the show with a horrible version of Simon and Garfunkel's America sets the wrong tone for me.

Not JT's fault. The good tracks are few - Jagger & Richards' Salt of the Earth was a great choice. Bon Jovi's Livin' On A Prayer is nice even if it was also included on Tribute to Heroes. The 'to hell with everybody' tone of their other two tunes almost negates Prayer's impact, though.

Five for Fighting also holds its own with a lovely piano-voice-cello version of the hit Superman. But John Rzeznick of Goo Goo Dolls had no voice to sing Iris, so it was left of the CD in favor of the band's cover of Tom Petty's American Girl, which doesn't require as much pure voice. Billy Joel was also not in the best vocal form, although his choice of Miami 2017 from his early catalog was eerie and bold. Melissa Etheridge's live performance was a technical nightmare that somehow the studio engineers managed to clean up. But her two songs only prove what I've always thought about her: she rocks hard, but she's predictable and boring. Warning: The Who gets 25 minutes for three songs on this recording.

The CD is sort of like the big family portrait which includes your sister\\'s loser boyfriend who she dumped 2 weeks after the picture, leaving you with a perfect picture, except for him, and you can\\'t crop him out.  Destiny\\'s Child also do not necessarily belong, but at least they covered a song \"Emotions\" written by someone more talented than themselves.\\nBut overall, this is just nitpicking. Get this CD.  You\\'ll love it!',\n",
       " 574: 'There have been a number benefit concerts in the last few months for the victims of the 9/11 tragedies and their families, but the biggest one in terms of musical star power was the one organized by Paul McCartney at Madison Square Garden on October 20th. Running for over five hours, the crowd (which included over 6000 firefighters, police officers & rescue workers who attended for free) was treated to stunning performances by a star-studded cast of musicians.\\nDavid Bowie opened the show with an acoustic version of Simon & Garfunkel\\'s \"America,\" followed by a rocking version of \"Heroes.\" The latter was a bit shaky at first, as Bowie didn\\'t get the lyrics quite right. Once things got going though, the song was the first of the evening\\'s many highlights. Up next is a trio of songs from Bon Jovi. Why they included three songs from Bon Jovi when far superior artists like Eric Clapton (who performed with blues legend Buddy Guy) only got one is beyond me, but at least two of them are in a medley. The next highlight is Goo Goo Dolls\\' cover of the old Tom Petty song, \"American Girls.\" It\\'s a shame they didn\\'t include \"Iris\" (which was performed before \"American Girls\") instead of one of the Bon Jovi songs, but hey...\\nBilly Joel really surprised me with his powerful rendition of (arguably his best song) \"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway).\" I honestly didn\\'t think he had it in him anymore. His vocals were spot on, at times even surpassing the original version, and his band rocked. Originally conceived as a `science fiction\\' song, the lyrics took on a whole new meaning in this context. \"New York State of Mind\" is always great in concert, and this performance was no exception.\\nIt\\'s always exciting when Eric Clapton & Buddy Guy play together, but their performance of \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" was nothing short of riveting. Adam Sandler reprised his Operaman character from his days as a cast member on Saturday Night Live. Unlike the telecast, he\\'s uncensored on the CD. Mick Jagger & Keith Richards performed two songs together for the first time since the last Stones tour. Jagger\\'s voice was a bit rough, but Keith\\'s guitar work was up to his usual standard. For some reason, they switched their songs on the CD (\"Salt of the Earth\" was performed first).\\nDisc two starts off with NYC firefighter Mike Moran\\'s comments. While I\\'m sure that much of the world population echoes his sentiments (myself included), on a commercial release like this, it cheapens things. Up next is three (of the four) songs by The Who. Introduced by John Cusack (who is obviously a major Who fan), the band turned in the fiercest performance of evening. Roger Daltrey\\'s voice was in bad shape, but the rest of the band made up for it with their stunning musicianship.\\nMelissa Etheridge\\'s performance was edited to keep CD buyers from hearing her forget the words to \"Come to My Window.\" Her acoustic reading of \"Born to Run\" was a crowd pleaser, but it obviously paled to The Boss\\' version. Ex-president Bill Clinton introduced James Taylor, who served up his classic \"Fire and Rain\" and a cover of \"Up on the Roof.\" Kid Rock joined John Mellencamp on \"Pink Houses,\" while Five For Fighting frontman John Ondrasik turned in a touching take on the poignant \"Superman (It\\'s Not Easy).\" Elton John\\'s solo rendition of \"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\" was another highpoint of the show. Like Billy Joel earlier in the show, Elton\\'s vocals were outstanding.\\nClosing the concert was Paul McCartney\\'s `extended\\' (if somewhat predictable) set. Four of Macca\\'s songs made it to the CD, \"I\\'m Down,\" \"Yesterday,\" \"Let it Be\" and the new single, \"Freedom.\" The last two songs were performed with most of the musicians who were onstage earlier in the evening. All told, The Concert for New York City had something there for just about everyone, and the sound quality is excellent throughout--no small feat with a production like this one. My only complaint is the editing between songs. The fades are too short and don\\'t sound natural. Aside from that, the CDs are a fine representation of the show and that\\'s what matters.\\nAll the proceeds from the concert, as well as net sales from the CD, benefit the Robin Hood Relief Fund (...)',\n",
       " 575: \"One of the eeriest moments of this splendid, live recording is Billy Joel's performance of Miami 2017 in which the terrible events of September 2001 seemed to be foretold.  The performer's voice breaks on the highs but it only seems to add to the pathos of his delivery.  Like any live album of this sort, there are highs and lows.  The highs, which include Mick Jagger and Keith Richard's powerhouse delivery of SALT OF THE EARTH, and Roger Daltrey's vocal on BABA O' REILLY, are some of the most passionate performances you've ever heard. And Daltrey's voice hardly sounds different from the one we heard thirty years ago.  The great sanity and gentleness of James Taylor's performance will, in the historic context of this event, draw tears from more than one listener.  Even Destiny's Child delivers beautifully in a Gospel Medley that will send shivers up your spine.  Amidst all this grandeur are more lackluster moments,including David Bowie's opening cover of Paul Simon's AMERICA, Adam Sandler's very odd performance of OPERAMAN and Backstreet Boys' surprisingly sleepy rendition of QUIT PLAYING GAMES WITH MY HEART. There are also some blisteringly fine performances that are plopped into the middle of the performance -- such as HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN performed by Eric Clapton and the beloved Buddy Guy,  that are so damned good, we want to hear another cut or two from the duo, but must settle for one.  Live performances are always a dog to record, but the four producers of this landmark recording did all they could to create a wide soundstage, balanced accoustics and minimal rolloff distortion during the loudest cuts.  Most of all, the audience is a living, breathing part of the recording; they react to the music, join with it, cheer it, even boo it once or twice.  All of net Sony's net proceeds on the album will benefit the Robin Hood fund, so it's an especially satisfying purchase too. Over all, I loved this album, warts and all.  It is one our children will share with their children.  It proves that music can be unbelievably healing. And who knows, you may even get up and dance to it once or twice. I did, and it felt great.\",\n",
       " 576: 'I bought this cd for my 6 y/o daughter who has been having trouble sleeping in her own room. She is a light sleeper and has a vivid imagination so she has trouble sleeping whether it be monsters under the bed, mean looking shadows, or bad dreams. We have tried EVERYTHING - \"magic\" bracelets, leaving lights on, night lights, stuffed animals, soft music, changing her room decor, letting the dog sleep in her room, dream catchers, fans, white noise machines, etc and NOTHING worked. It has been almost a year since she slept through the night without getting up and either coming into my bed or sleeping on the floor next to my bed. We tried sticker charts, punishments, reasoning, logic... still, NOTHING worked. From the first day that we bought this CD, she has stayed in her room. Some nights I hear her wake up and turn it on in the middle of the night but she stays in HER room, in HER bed! It has only been a week or so since we bought the CD but I have noticed that she is waking up less frequently so hopefully she will start to sleep all the way through the night soon. The story on the CD is cute and she likes it a lot. It is a little sing-songy but then it is geared towards young children. If you are having problems like I was then this CD is worth a try.',\n",

       " 578: \"My 4 year old son became terrified while listening to this CD.  He has done meditation daily using the Indigo Dreams series and never had this reaction.  I am not sure why, but maybe the chimes used in the background were foreign to him.  He is a very happy, joy- filled child, but has been crying so much over the last two days after listening to this.  He says it is the meditation that has given him bad dreams.  Anyways, I hope other children aren't affected the way mine was.  I really regret exposing him to it.\",\n",
       " 579: \"Speed Sleep has truly revolutionized my life.  I have always believed that getting the proper amount of sleep is important for optimal function-I can feel myself dragging if I don't get a full night's sleep.  But, realistically, I can rarely sleep 8 hours a night.  So, I would find myself wanting a nap a few times a week.  But, inevitably, I would sleep for hours and still get up feeling groggy and unrested.\\nI was definitely skeptical when I first tried Speed Sleep-I find a choir of trumpets would be inadequate in rousing me from my naps.  But, it's truly amazing!  Each time I use it, I fall asleep faster and each time I am delighted when I find myself awake and recharged at the end of the 25 minutes.\\nIn the few weeks I've used Speed Sleep, I've not only saved hours of nap time but also become more productive in my increased waking hours.  I would strongly recommend this CD.  If you're busy with work or school, Speed Sleep is a great tool to revitalize quickly and increase your efficiency.\",\n",
       " 580: 'Saw no improvement',\n",
       " 581: \"Zzzzzzzz. I'm still awake!\",\n",
       " 582: \"It works! I bought this CD unknowingly that it was spoken. I imagined it was some kind of relaxing music that was scientifically proved to promote deep sleep. As a result, I now read twice the description of the product Im about to buy.\\nThat said, I definitely don't regret having bought this CD. Its the first spoken CD that I own, and it IS effective, it truly IS relaxing. Spoken CDs may work for some people and may not for others. I was never very enthusiast about listening to spoken CDs, now I understand that they work.\\nThis CD contains 2 tracks. The first is designed for a 25 minute nap, generally after lunch. The second one is designed for a full night sleep. I first listened to the second track during the night. I can tell you that I remember listening the guy speak for 8 minutes or so and then I blacked out. He hypnotizes you for real! Then he brainwashes you to kill the president of Honolulu. Is Honolulu a country?\\n\\nHowever, the next day arose an upsetting, then I tried to sleep by listening the same track, and it didn't happen. For this to work you need to be stress and anxiety free. If you had a bad day, its hard to let aside the things that are bothering you. Tell you what, if this is the case, don't even attempt to listen Speed Sleep because it won't work, that simple. Important: Do not drink coffee, alcohol or any other stimulant prior to sleeping. Taking a warm shower can help you relax before hitting the bed.\\n\\nMoving on with the other track... After successfully trying out the second track, I tested the first track designed for a 25 minute nap. Turns out it was quite similar in content as the second track. It quickly knocked me out as well. After 25 minutes have passed, a strenuous sound of a cannon blast awakens you just kiddin. No cannon blasts on this CD. A relaxing music plays along with the spoken instructions, until it fades off at the end of the track.\\n\\nThe pros: Its a healthy, fast-action drug-free alternative to fight off insomnia and itll get you to sleep in no time. The strangely curious yet fascinating thing about this CD is that you awake with a fully recovered body and having a positive mindset. Youll have to try it yourself to understand what Im talking about. The cons: Consequently, with time and use, you might get tired of the same words being spoken, and you would look elsewhere for more variety. All in all its a good product, you should try it out! Nice experience.\",\n",

After owning \"Freedom\" since it\\'s initial release in October 1999, I still find it to be a CD that spends much of its time circulating in my multi-disc player and I always have a copy of it with me in the car....you just can\\'t grow tired of this album.  I can\\'t pick just one outstanding song because they\\'re all pretty outstanding...but there\\'s a reason why the beautiful ballad \"Barefoot Ballet\" just won a 2002 Emmy for \"Best Original Song\" used on a daytime program...it\\'s one of the most sensuous, memorable songs I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of hearing (dig the opening lyrics of \"Steel on velvet, silk on stone, sun-warmed leather, set against chrome...you\\'re a contrast to what I\\'ve become, and no one has touched me like you.\")  \"Let It Go\" is inspiring to the core, the rocker \"Anything\" gets a real groove going, you\\'ll find yourself singing along to \"September\", and the title track definitely kicks...!  \"Man On Fire\" is dark and mysterious, very intriguing.....\"Hero\" is a rocking-good love song very appropriate for being sung by this talented actor (\"I want to be your hero, let me be your leading man\".  \"From The Heart\" is a winner....and the album\\'s epic closing track \"The Journey\" is reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac\\'s classic \"The Chain\" - both tunes were written as a group by all the band members and therefore showcases each musician\\'s outstanding talents.  While I was first introduced to Kurth & Taylor via their appearances on \"General Hospital\", I quickly realized they are MUCH more than that....these are dedicated, gifted musicians who have that rare ability to create unforgettable music. And if you ever have a chance to catch them in concert, don\\'t pass it up...these guys exude a tremendous energy onstage that no recording studio can capture, you will be blown away by their live performance. This is serious rock and roll, no fluffy pop music.  The icing on the cake is that these are genuinely nice guys who devote much of their time to performing charity events, raising money for a variety of worthy causes.

       " 626: 'I recently bought \"Rescue You\" and was extremely disappointed with it, so when I read all the rave reviews here on Amazon I was compelled to write a review of my own.\\n-\\nFirst off let me say that I\\'m only 26 and was not a fan of JLT in the \\'80s, I only started listening to him in the mid-1990s when I discovered Rainbow.  Once I got into Rainbow I went out and bought everything else I could find that JLT sang on.  I love Odyssey, Slaves & Masters, HTP, and most of Joe\\'s recent solo albums.  I thought Holy Man was particularly strong, and really enjoyed JLT and The Usual Suspects as well.  Based on all this, I decided I had to have Rescue You.  Of course it was out of print until only recently, so I waited a long time before getting to hear Rescue You.\\n-\\nOnce I found out that Wounded Bird had reissued Rescue You I ordered my copy right away.  I was really looking forward to hearing this album.  Chronologically this album is sandwiched right between BENT OUT OF SHAPE and ODYSSEY, two albums that I really enjoy, so I was expecting RESCUE YOU to be a good album, if not great.  I can\\'t even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when I finally heard this album.  It\\'s not terrible, but let me tell you that RESCUE YOU does not hold a candle to any other album that Joe has done as a solo artist or as a full fledged band member(the only exceptions being Fandango, which I have not heard, and the many one-off and guest appearances Joe has done, ie. Brazen Abbot, etc, which I have also not heard for the most part).  Here is a breakdown of what I liked and disliked about this album; you\\'ll notice that the bad far outweighs the good!\\n-\\nThe Prosecution:  When you play this album, right off the bat you will notice how terrible and dated the production is.  The drum sound is attrocious, with that horrible \\'80s big snare-drum sound.  The rhythym guitars are absolutely buried in the mix, to the point that you can barely hear whatever riffs the guitarist might be playing.  Worst of all are the cheesy \\'80s sythesizers which are positively dripping off of this album.  I thought I was trapped in an episode of Miami Vice!  Don\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t dislike \\'80s rock or synths when they\\'re used tastefully, like Don Airey or David Rosenthal\\'s work in Rainbow, but the synths on RESCUE YOU are completely out of control.  We\\'re not just talking about holding down chords here either; almost every song features synth \"stabs\" that are mixed so jarringly loud and are so cliched that any good elements of the song are wasted.  The songwriting is not terrible, but is definitely sub-par.  \"Losing You\", \"Rescue You\" and maybe one or two others could have been solid deep album tracks if they\\'d been produced properly, but this album is missing the one or two great songs that quite often save an otherwise sub-par album.  \"The Race Is On\" is decent as well, but it really strikes me as a weak attempt at a fast Rainbow number; I\\'d rather go listen to \"Spotlight Kid\" again, thanks.  Finally, the lyrics on this album are pretty bad, even for JLT who has not always been the most creative lyricist; just because \"rough\" and \"tough\" rhyme with eachother doesn\\'t mean they should ever actually be used in a song!\\n-\\nThe Defense:  The only real saving grace of this album is that Joe\\'s voice sounds great.  Somehow Joe\\'s voice is able to rise above all the poorly produced instruments(well maybe not the synths) and show of his great tone and delivery.  Don\\'t get me wrong, Joe\\'s voice is not enough to save an album this bad, but hearing his voice sounding so good at least reminds me why I bought RESCUE YOU in the first place, and makes me feel like less of an idiot for wasting my money on it!\\n-\\nThe Verdict: Given the many strong albums Joe has sung on, and the handful of downright classics, RESCUE YOU is shockingly bad in comparison.  If you are a casual fan, don\\'t waste your money.  If you are a completist like me, you are going to buy this album no matter what I say, so just don\\'t get your hopes up.  To anyone who has already bought this album and was turned off by it, don\\'t give up on JLT, because pretty much everything else he\\'s ever done is better than RESCUE YOU.  Go out and buy THE USUAL SUSPECTS and rock out to \"The Power of Love\".  If your collection is missing RESCUE YOU, you\\'re not missing much!\\n-\\nFinally, look closely at the reviews below.  One of the reviews states (paraphrased): \"if you are a fan of Bon Jovi, Foreigner, etc, you will like RESCUE YOU.\"  Well, I don\\'t know anybody who got into JLT because they like Bon Jovi.  Everyone I know who has ever even heard of JLT is coming from a hard-rock/classic-metal background.  I\\'d imagine most people who like JLT were first into Deep Purple, then Rainbow, and then JLT.  I don\\'t think anyone who comes from that kind of musical background will enjoy this CD, not because it\\'s not \"heavy enough\", but because it\\'s not original enough, not timeless enough, and just plain not good enough.  If you enjoyed DIFFICULT TO CURE, ODYSSEY, or SLAVES & MASTERS, you would probably enjoy a lot of JLT\\'s more recent work; however you will probably find RESCUE YOU utterly cheesy and unlistenable.',\n",

The music ranges from straight rock and roll on \"One Bad Ho-Tep\", to surf music on \"PBBS\", to scary haunting Egyptian chantings in tracks such as \"Elder Hole\", to fifties slow dance pop on \"The Shady Rest.\" Of all the music on the CD, though, the best is the classic theme found in several variations throughout the soundtrack, notably on \"The King\\'s Highway\", and \"Bubba Ho-Tep End Title Themes.\"\\nWhen you see this movie be sure to watch the special feature on Brian Tyler and the making of the soundtrack. This edition is an autographed edition, and costs a bit more and is scarce, but the same musical material is available without the signatures at a lower price.\\nI am not generally a fan of soundtracks, but once you see the movie, and hear the music, I think you will understand why I make an exception here. I highly recommend this CD.',\n",

I have actually\\nthrown duplicate copies of the latter two cds into the trash simply because I thought the music was so\\nhorrendous. People fell in love with Steve Gaines because he played with a great band for a year and a half.\\nSteve Gaines became a household name because he first played with Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, the band and\\nbecause he wrote some with Ronnie Van Zant. Steve was a good guitar player and he brought a lot to Skynyrd. Steve\\nexpanded the range of Skynyrd for a short time. But then too so did Ed King whom Gaines replaced on guitar.\\nSkynyrd was always better with three guitars. The three guitar lineup fleshed Lynyrd Skynyrd into a rock\\nand roll contender. Sure, Allen Collins and Gary Rossington were great on guitar but something was still lacking.\\nThe third guitarist fleshed out the band and completed and complemented it.\\n\\nOf the three Steve Gaines cds that were released commercially, all I can say of them is that they clearly show\\na musician who was making some very non professional or novice music. To my ears the music is mostly quite bad.\\nAnd of the choices for songs I can only ask where was this guy was coming from?\\n\\nSteve Gaines became an instant LEGEND because he DIED after a short tenure with Lynyrd Skynyrd. In that short\\nperiod the man thrilled us by being at his peronal BEST. He wrote and sang \"Ain\\'t No Good Life.\" LEGEND, the\\nSkynyrd album of 1987 introduced us to Steve\\'s song \"One in the Sun\", which is another decent Skynyrd song. Steve\\nalso wrote \"I Know A Little\", and he was involved somehow in \"You Got That Right\" and \"I Never Dreamed.\" This\\nwas Steve Gaines at the HEIGHT of his professional career.\\n\\nNow forget about the short Skynyrd tenure and you have a man playing what, The Holiday Inn or some bar. Ronnie\\nand Skynyrd RESCUED Steve Gaines from complete OBSCURITY. And let me say that Steve Gaines served Ronnie well\\nin a time when he had writer\\'s block. Ronnie was somewhat exhausted musically when Steve joined the band. Ronnie\\nwas the heart and soul of the band. Ronnie was the leader. Steve brought some personal MATURITY to the band. Steve\\nhelped with some vocals and gave Ronnie the ONLY REST he ever got on vocals.\\n\\nHowever, all three of Steve\\'s albums/collections serve little more than to remind us of what Lynyrd Skynyrd did\\nfor Steve Gaines. Steve may never have made it without Skynyrd. From what I hear of Steve\\'s music I feel the man\\nprobably would never have made it. Luckily though Skynyrd FOUND Steve via his sister Cassie Gaines. Cassie is the\\none who told Skynyrd about her guitar playing brother.\\n\\nRest in Peace Steve and Cassie, and all the lost Skynyrd members.',\n",

I\\'m not sure if Rosemary\\'s arrangements were used, but if so they do NOT suit Debby\\'s  voice. I was also put off by some odd vocal stylings. Listen to the \"blue\" in \"Blue Skies\".

If any song cries out for a big finish it\\'s that one! \"You\\'re Gonna Hear From Me\" is a great powerful song - but not here! This is the kind of singing and arranging done for/by a 65 or 70 year old whose voice has deepened and/or who doesn\\'t have much power or range anymore. Don\\'t get me wrong - Debby\\'s voice is still a beautiful  golden ribbon and I know she still has a pretty higher register - on the few instances it\\'s used on this cd - but for the most part it\\'s hidden in a bland cloak of mediocrity.',\n",

The issue there is that the lyrics are only for one song, \"Wir fahren gegen Engeland\".  It\\'s a famous tune, and it\\'s nice to have that.  Unhappily that is nearly the extent of the liner notes.  There is no info on the original recordings - where and when they were made, who recorded them originally, historic significance of a particular piece, etc.  I reckon you can Google it if you really want to know about it !\\n\\nYou do get a nice U-boat illustration on the front cover, and a miniature historic photo on the back, along with a cheesy promo shot of PzG\\'s owner, Mr. Kelly - and his dog.  The micro-font text used for the track listing there is also less than helpful.  Perhaps this was all miniaturized from an LP and the liner notes inside went missing in the transition...?\\n\\nThe music itself is fine.  The historic recordings are apparently reproduced without the benefit of remastering technology ( but I can\\'t speak conclusively here, as there are no liner notes !).  The glorious (or not - depending on your perspective) sound of 1930s/1940s recordings is there for the listener.  It is, to the best of my knowledge, a fairly complete review of the best known German Navy tunes of WWII.\\n\\nSince my primary interest is in the history here, and the music is contextual, I\\'m not disturbed by the sound quality.

Certainly Marrying Maiden doesn\\'t quite live up to the greatness of their debut, but even the 1971 followup, Choice Quality Stuff/Anytime isn\\'t that bad. The front cover names the bands as It\\'s a Big Bad Beautiful Day, but in reality, they were still It\\'s a Beautiful Day, even if they started witnessing some drastic lineup changes (let\\'s not forget their manager, Matthew Katz didn\\'t exactly make life easy for the band). This time around, they gave the two halfs of the albums separate names, the first half being Choice Quality Stuff (side one, if you own the LP) and the second half being Anytime (side two). Almost like two EPs that make up one full-length album. This album finds the band doing some new styles, in fact the Choice Quality Stuff half of the album finds the band exploring hard rock. \"Creed of Love\", and the Latin-influenced \"Words\" are prime example what I\\'m talking about, in fact the latter featured two Santana percussionists (Coke Escovedo and Jose Chepito Areas) as guests (meaning that song has a strong Santana-like feel to it, which is unusual for this band). The band was starting to have lineup difficulties at this point, and they even included Tom Fowler, who would later appear on Frank Zappa\\'s Mothers (like on Over-Nite Sensation). Luckily violinist/vocalist David LaFlamme and vocalist Patti Santos are still here. \"No Words For Glad\" features some nice use of flute, perhaps the one song most point to their old sound, with hippie-oriented lyrics. The second half of the album has mellower pieces, like \"Place of Dreams\", \"Anytime\", and \"Misery Loves Company\". \"Oranges and Apples\" is an instrumental piece not unlike \"Bombay Calling\", although not quite as good. \"Bitter Wine\" is another great piece, and additional violin was provided by Sid Page, who was a member of Dan Hicks & His Hot Licks (LaFlamme was briefly a member of this group before It\\'s a Beautiful Day formed). Certainly there\\'s a couple songs I can live without, like the boogie-influenced \"Bye Bye Love\" and \"Anytime\", but there\\'s enough great stuff here to make it worth having. To be honest, this album isn\\'t bad at all. In fact, you\\'ll be surprised how much of this album rocks.\\n\\nIn 1972 they followed Choice Quality Stuff with Live at Carnegie Hall, but then the group pretty much fell apart, David LaFlamme, pretty much the guy giving IABD it\\'s distinct characteristic, like his voice and violin, had left. Now for many people think IABD was through without his presence. The group now included future Pablo Cruise member Budd Cockrell  with violinst Gregory Bloch. Bloch would later find himself with Italian proggers PFM (on their 1977 album Jet Leg during that group\\'s brief stay in Los Angeles). The only IABD member left was Pattie Santos.\\n\\nNow this 1973 studio followup, called It\\'s a Beautiful Day... Today gets highly maligned even for the few that defend Choice Quality Stuff. For one thing, the vocals aren\\'t as pleasant as LaFlamme\\'s. But musically the album isn\\'t bad. The music is now firmly in the post-psychedelic style, with a strangely Southern Rock feel in many of the cuts, like \"Mississippi Delta\". I hear elements of folk and even soul in many of the pieces. Really, it sounds like a whole new band calling itself It\\'s a Beautiful Day. Listen to their 1969 debut with \"White Bird\", then listen to this, you can\\'t believe it\\'s the same band, since it really isn\\'t the same band, aside from Pattie Santos. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to give ...Today a four star rating.

After I read numerous reviews and the product descriptions for both, I decided to buy Speed Sleep II for Health and Fitness because one of the product descriptions explicitly said it contains the same material as the original Speed Sleep program, but with positive reinforcement of good eating habits.  Well apparently the statement \"the beginning and ending are identical\" refers only to the first track of Speed Sleep, not the entire album (nap program, nighttime program).  Since the last section of the nap program is a voice telling you to reverse your journey and wake up, it isn\\'t very helpful to someone hoping to fall asleep for the night.  My main problem is the difference between what I thought I was getting (a nap and a nighttime program) and what I received (a nap program only).  I just want potential new buyers to be aware of this major difference between Speed Sleep and Speed Sleep II.',\n",

The comparisons that I have read in others' review is not quite doing this artist justice.  She is unigue in the way that Sade is unique.

The front cover is just the image of the side profile of a woman.  The listener can just listen to the music and not judge her on what they think she should sound like because she is of an asian backround.

When I first heard of this album, it was pretty rare and not cheap.  Thankfully, we\\'ve got this recent reissue to sink our teeth into, and it\\'s affordable!\\n\\nAs far as British psychedelic rock goes (and I definitely count myself a fan of the genre), July fares really well.  They existed in an era when rock was still single-driven, so the album features a couple tracks that were much more popular as singles than the entire album or the band ever managed to get.  \"My Clown\" is classic British radio psych, with trippy, treated guitars and vocal harmonies.  The song\\'s fade-out is priceless haze.  Probably my favorite track is #2, the less-successful single \"Dandelion Seeds,\" which moves on a pretty jazzy groove and features a really far-out bridge.  \"Jolly Mary\" is classic whimsical British pop a la \"Yellow Submarine\" or \"My White Bicycle\" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Tomorrow/dp/B00000IBDY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Tomorrow</a>&nbsp;or any of Syd Barrett\\'s more playful moments on&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Piper-at-the-Gates-of-Dawn/dp/B000T05R8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</a>.  Other highlights are the sitar-driven \"The Way\" and the odd but pounding \"Crying is for Writers.\"\\n\\nThe whole record has a slightly lo-fi (though the remastering is good) sound to it, but it goes along pleasantly with the style of performance and music.  At times, the vocals can be a bit rough, but usually it\\'s endearing.  It\\'s also worth noting that one aspect that separates July from the rest of the British psychedelic pack of the day is the use of \"world\" instruments like tabla and sitar (though sitar really wasn\\'t uncommon in those days).  These elements definitely foreshadow the sublime works that would later be produced by Jade Warrior that would fuse heavy guitar with saturated atmospheres and world folk music elements. A few tracks don\\'t leave as strong of impressions as others (not surprising for an era when singles were the focus), but overall July is just as strong an album as most of the classics of the era whose names are often tossed around.

       " 858: 'I\\'m not much for opera. I attend one in concert every 5-10 years and don\\'t own a single recording of any opera. I own collections from my favorites that I\\'ve seen live -- \"Don Giovanni\", \"Barber of Seville\", \"Otello\" and \"Fidelio\".\\n\\nI\\'ve owned several collections of highlights from \"Don Giovanni\", which is to opera what Beethoven\\'s 9th is to symphonies. I\\'ve also seen it in performance twice and saw Karajan conduct it live once on PBS. What shocked me most about the latter were two things: the titanic Karajan was a short guy, probably about 5-5, and appeared a dwarf on stage after the production; and the final scene, where the Don goes to Hell, was constructed electronically with bizarre concentric circles into which the Don was swallowed and disappeared. The final go to Hell scene in the film \"Amadeus\" is much better.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the final scene is like in this performance since I\\'ve never seen the movie. But I\\'ve savored the \"soundtrack\" for almost three decades. It is clearly the best work Lorin Maazel has ever done, better than his 1960s Tchaikovsky and Sibelus symphonies, the second and third best things he\\'s ever done.\\n\\nWhen first I bought this highlight package the Internet was still a military-only operation and the score was not available in USA. Eschewing a scratchy LP in 1979, I bought the chrome cassette from a British dealer. I later burned a high quality CD from my cassette. You, of course, have the advantage of both the Internet and the availability of this wonderful music here in a direct to CD recording.\\n\\nThis is a dramatic telling of the story of Don Juan, his ribald antics, his contribution to the death of a woman and her father, and his comeuppance when one of the most bizarre figures in all art -- the commendatore -- comes to life and sentences him to Hell, where the Don goes in a blazing scene.\\n\\nRaimondi\\'s Don is dramatic and dynamic and he sings the part very well. The other members of the cast, Edda Moser as Donna Anna, Kiri Te Kanawa as Donna Elvira, Kenneth Riegel as Don Ottavio, Jaoyn Macurdy as the Commendatore, Jose Van Dam as Leporello, Malcom King as Masetto and a then not well-known Teresa Berganza as Zerlina -- are, in a word, wonderful. The singing on this collection is beyond criticism and continues to stand up to the best recorded accounts almost 30 years later.\\n\\nThe sound on this recording is very good, natural and captured as if taken from a staged recording. No accommodation is needed for the sound, which is five by five and warm. If you want an introduction to the wonders of \"Don Giovanni\" you can\\'t do better than this.',\n",
       " 859: \"Perhaps because it is only the soundtrack to Joseph Losey's film of the opera, this Don Giovanni has never come into its own. The cast is the best on records, barring only EMI's classic set under Giulini. It was prescient of Maazel to gather up young singers who would soon be major stars like Te Kanawa--gorgeous as Donna Elvira--and Eda Moser, who's dramatically intense as Donna Anna, despite some pitch problems. Ruggero Raimondi as a suave Don and Jose Van Dam as a bitter, insidious Leporello are quite fine, as is Teresa Berganza as Zerlina. Only the wobbly Kenneth Riegel disappoints as Don Ottavio, but hardly anyone succeeds vocally in the fiendish arias assigned to him.\\n\\nMaazel pulls no perverse punches. He's mostly straightforward, although at times he takes pains to underline the drama for the camera, which is all to the good. From the fierce opening scene you'd think this was going to be an angry, thuggish Don (I wish it had been), but soon Raimondi lapses into smooth, somewhat bland singing that emphasizes mellifluous tone over character.  Too bad, since everything else is outstanding. Sony's sonics are fine, and the orchestra plays very well.\\n\\nIn sum, this almost great Don Giovanni deserves a listen. It's among the best on the market, lacking only a charismatic Don to rise to the very top. If you object to Wachter's brutishness on the Giulini set or dislike the gloss of Karajan's conducting on the stary DG set, this one from Maazel may turn into a first choice.\",\n",

With words and music by John McCarthy, arranged and produced as always for the boys by David Carroll, the back of the album uses pictographs (a temple for \"Greece,\" cartoon heads of the boys for \"Smothers Brothers,\" etc.) to explain to the kiddies what the whole idea of Aesop\\'s fables being retold by the Smothers Brothers \"for their own day.\"  The fact that \"day\" was in the mid-1960s, before the Summer of Love and all of the social turmoil at the end of that particular decade does not really date this album, whose thesis, after all, is that Aesop still has something to say thousands of years after his fables were first told.\\n\\nMost adults will recognize most of the seven fables that make up the main part of this album: \"The Greedy Dog,\" \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf,\" \"The Dog and the Thief,\" \"The Farmer and His Sons,\" \"The Fox and His Grapes,\" \"The Bird and the Jar,\" and \"The Two Frogs.\"  Just as you would expect, Dickie tries to teach a valuable lesson (e.g., \"Necessity is the mother of invention,\" \"Together we stand, divided we fall\"), while Tommy keeps getting off track and the brothers end up bickering before singing a song that drives home the lesson (e.g., \"Nobody likes a liar\").  Of course sometimes they bicker during the song and afterwards: Dickie likes to end the lesson by saying \"That is a good thing to remember,\" and Tommy will add, \"Yeah, even if you are not a wolf,\" which works for the story of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf,\" but \"even if you are not a stick\" does not make as much sense after \"The Farmer And His Sons\" and the track has to fade away while the boys go after each other.  In between each fable on each \"side\" of the album Tommy does a brief song about wanting to be a fox, fly, or some other animal only to decide \"Maybe I\\'d Better Stay Me\" after hearing dogs barking, a flyswatter, etc.  The album ends with a reprise of \"Aesop Knew\" that works in the morals from the seven tales.\\n\\nIf when you hear the name of the Smothers Brothers and think about the Yo-Yo Man then this album would probably be of more interest to you than if you automatically think of Brothers Smothers being fired from CBS in 1969.  \"Aesop\\'s Fables the Smothers Brothers Way\" is the second of what is now three comedy albums by the boys that Laugh.

From the blaring guitars and driving beats of the opening selection, \"Born to Be Wild\" by Steppenwolf, to the angry soulful \"Cloud Nine\" by the Temptations, on through the mournful \"Abraham, Martin, and John\" by Dion, this CD will place you in the midst of Vietnam protests, and dismay over the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.  But even in the uneasy social climate of 1968, respite was found in music.  There is the sunny feathery \"Beautiful Morning\" by The Rascals, the bubble gum hit \"Valerie\" by the Monkees, and the gorgeous slow-dance soul ballad \"Lalah Means I Love You\" by The Delfonics.

Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece.',\n",

She contributed to Neil Young\\'s \"The Old Laughing Lady\" and \"I\\'ve Loved Her So Long\" on his self-titled debut album in 1968, sings on Joe Cocker\\'s \"Feelin\\' Alright\" from his \"With A Little Help From My Friends\" debut album from 1969 and is on Allen Toussaint\\'s magical \"From A Whisper To A Scream\" (1970). Just as impressively Merry sings on \"Way Over Yonder\", \"Where You Lead\" and \"Smackwater Jack\" on Carole King\\'s magisterial \"Tapestry\" album (1971). Then there are sessions for B.B. King, Jesse Davis, Neil Diamond, Charles Wright, Jimmy Witherspoon, Billy Preston, Lee Michaels, Linda Ronstadt, Leon Russell, Ruth Copeland, Chi Coltrane, David T. Walker, Etta James, Rare Earth, The Who and even Ringo Starr. But her most famous outing has to be her duet vocals with Mick Jagger on \"Gimme Shelter\" - one of the standout album tracks from \"Let It Bleed\" - the Rolling Stones masterpiece from 1969 (it was the first album produced by Jimmy Miller who suggested Merry for the vocals). She even turns up on Lynyrd Skynyrd\\'s \"Sweet Home Alabama\" in 1974 and \"Cornflake Girl\" by Tori Amos in 1994... So it\\'s hardly surprising that she signed to Lou Adler\\'s Ode Records in the late Sixties and quickly pushed out two solo albums - \"Merry Clayton\" from 1971 - and this - \"Gimme Shelter\" - her debut from 1970.\\n\\nReleased on Ode Records SP-77001 in the USA and on A&M Records AMLS 995 in the UK in late 1970 - the original vinyl album featured a world-class session band (Victor Feldman on Vibes, Joe Sample of The Crusaders on keyboards to name but two) and was top-heavy with contemporary cover versions of the time (but in a good way). It doesn\\'t say who\\'s remastered this 2010 Repertoire reissue CD on REP 5176 (38:23 minutes) but the sticker on the card digipak claims that it\\'s been beautifully done - and they\\'d be right. The sound quality is fantastic - lending the Soul-meets-Gospel feel of the songs a huge sonic punch. Very little hiss - you can hear piano, drums, sweet bass and guitar strings rattling - loads of presence - it\\'s a top job done. The 12-page inlay has affectionate and knowledgeable liner notes by noted UK writer CHRIS WELCH.\\n\\nMusically this is uplifting Soul with organs, brass, girly backing singers and impassioned lead vocals - a sort of Atlantic Aretha Franklin one moment then United Artists Tina Turner the next. And right from her opening cover of James Taylor\\'s \"Country Road\" - the album hits you with one classy tune after another. Number 2 is another upbeat reinterpretation - a great variant of The Doors \"Tell All The People\". But both are aced by a slowed-down and deeply soulful version of Simon and Garfunkel\\'s beautiful anthem \"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\".  Written by Galt McCormack \"I\\'ve Got Life\" started out in the \"Hair\" musical and was made famous by Nina Simone on her 1968 \"Nuff \\'Said\" album. Side 1 ends with her own superb guitar-and-brass take on \"Gimme Shelter\" with its \"just a shot away...\" lyrics (it was issued as the 1st of 2 singles off the album in the USA on Ode Records ODE-66003 with \"Good Girls\" as its flipside).\\n\\nSide Two opens with pure magic - a cover of the James Cleveland song \"Here Comes Those Heartaches Again\" done originally by Kim Weston on her 1970 album \"Big Brass Four Poster\" (on James Brown\\'s People label). It doesn\\'t say who added the strings but the song suddenly elevates into sublime Jimmy Webb territory - a little like \"5:30 Plane\" by The Supremes on their 1972 Motown LP \"The Supremes Produced And Arranged By Jimmy Webb\" (see review for the Hip-O Select Supremes box set \"This Is The Story...\"). That gorgeous orchestration appears again on the album\\'s lone original \"I Ain\\'t Gonna Worry My Life Away\" - a blistering Etta James type torch ballad that Merry co-wrote with Billy Preston (lyrics from it title this review). The other superb Preston contribution here is \"You\\'ve Been Acting Strange\" - his own version surfaced on his September 1970 Apple Records album \"Encouraging Words\" (also reviewed). There\\'s a Jimmy Miller (Rolling Stones Producer) and Gary Wright (of Spooky Tooth) song too called \"Forget It, I Got It\" which is so slinky and very cool. It was used as the B-side to \"Country Road\" issued as a 45 in the USA on Ode Records ODE-66007 (the 2nd and last single off the album). Things are brassed-up again with Billy Page\\'s \"Good Girls\" and rounded off with a crowd-in-the studio version of \"Glad Tidings\" - a Van Morrison cover from his 1970 \"Moondance\" album that doesn\\'t quite work for me. Others like it though as an upbeat finisher.

The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic \" MY EVERYTHING \" with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of \" AH SHOOT \", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly true! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, \" AH SHOOT \" is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear \" AH SHOOT \" the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn\\'t the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I\\'d give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star.

       " 898: \"The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.\\n\\n As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.\\n\\n So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.\\n\\n Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover.

His past work is legendary, and are among the greatest ever written, even if I personally have to endure the political angle of some of his lyrics.\\n\\nRecently Mr. Guerra took a very unfortunate turn towards \"Christian merengue\" which I found objectionable and of lower musical quality moreover.\\n\\nMercifully, this new album is just love songs, free of politics and religion (as far as I can tell - I am not a fluent Spanish speaker) - and it is a real winner. While it may not quite have the unique rustic  charm of his greatest work, it is, on the hand, more modern and accessible, his technical singing abilities have matured magnificently, plus the recording quality of this CD is a big improvement over his earlier ones.\\n\\nThe first half of the album includes an infectious mambo, an abolutely magnificent bachata, Qaue Me Des Tu Carino,  and the kind of high spirited salsa and merengue we associate with this artist. It is similar to his old work, but different.\\n\\nThe second half of the album is perhaps a bit less impressive. The best here is an intriguing mellow salsa Cancioncita De Amor, and a ballad Sabia Manera in which Guerra sings more beautifully than I have ever heard him. On the basis of this one song alone, I would say Guerra has the finest male voice in Latin music today.\\n\\nThe other songs in the second half are fine, but relatively conventional compared to the rest of the album. Plus the title tune, La Llave de mi Corazon is a straight repeat of Medicine for My Soul, but in Spanish. The Final \"bonus\" song A La Vera is beautiful, but abbreviated.\\n\\nI would not say La Llave de mi Corazon surpasses Guerra\\'s best work of the 80s and the 90s , but that is really not important. It is good to see that Mr. Guerra has come up with an album  that retains much of what has made him so great, but without repeating himself.\\n\\nWith all the dreary music being released today, that La Llave de Mi Corazon should get a \"Best Album\" award is a no-brainer.',\n",

Somebody should ask this guy what his musical influences are, and then maybe we'll have a clear picture of whether or not he can actually distinguish good music from bad music.

The singing is unbearable, and honestly, laughable. When I began listening I had no idea what it was going to be, it was bearable...until the vocals kicked in, the words were mostly incomprehensable (which isn't ALWAYS bad, but in this case...) when lyrics could be heard it was honestly laughable.

They probably weren\\'t released for good reason.  And the bastardization of \"Take Good Care of My Baby\" is truly disgusting.  The ballad version originally released on his UA album in the 70s was nice but this alternate version asks the question--what happened to the melody??? And you have no idea who produced or arranged anything since the new producers decided to lump all the credits together (but keeping their\\'s prominent.)  Shame on them.
