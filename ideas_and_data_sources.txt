todo:
 - Make a final RQ: ""

Ideas for project
 - train different models on different data sources (related to sentiment analysis) such as twitter, 
reddit, yt etc.
 - see how model x trained on y data source performs on predicting other data sources, maybe 1 source
is better than others, why? Maybe 1 model is better than others, why? Can possibly try training partly 
on all sources and see if it performs better.

TODO:
 - Validation Train different LSTM's on each domain source (IMDB, reddit, etc.) and save them to a 
folder
 - Print performance measured of the models on all other domains (how does IMDB trained model perform 
on all other domains?)
 - Using performance of these models, decide amount of each domain should be present in the final 
compiled data
 - Test this model and compare its performance to an LSTM trained on all datasets, and an LSTM trained
on a an amount of data where each domain contributes equally
