todo:
 - Make a final RQ: ""

Ideas for project
 - train different models on different data sources (related to sentiment analysis) such as twitter, 
reddit, yt etc.
 - see how model x trained on y data source performs on predicting other data sources, maybe 1 source
is better than others, why? Maybe 1 model is better than others, why? Can possibly try training partly 
on all sources and see if it performs better.

NEED TO DECIDE:
 - Should we only take datasets already in positive/negative format or should we also use datasets
with star reviews and fx if it ranges from 1-5, say 1/2 is negative, 4/5 is positive and ignore 3?
