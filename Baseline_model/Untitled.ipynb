This particular compilation has several. I sought it out primarily for \"Pieces of Me,\" but seeing contributions by Informatik, Seabound, Mesh, Ghost & Writer, among others made it a keeper.\\n\\nThe Birthday Massacre\\'s take on Skold\\'s \"Tonight\" I thought was superior to the Anomie version (but then I\\'m also pretty keen on TBM lately with the release of Hide and Seek.) KMFDM\\'s \"Amnesia\" is pretty standard fare for them, but it brings guitars along with the beats, which is nice. As you might expect the rougher edge of this compilation is found with Front Line Assembly\\'s \"Angriff\" and Encephalon\\'s \"The Transhuman Condition,\" which is also a danceable tune.\\n\\nAdding some atmosphere, we have Seabound\\'s contribution of \"The Escape\" as does Informatik\\'s \"World of Wonder,\" a touching track in the same vein as their album Beyond. Makes me hungry for both of their next releases! This mix of Ghost & Writer\\'s \"Fraud\" is fairly pared down at first, but I love the last half compared to the two versions included on their album \"Shipwrecks.\" Stromkern\\'s \"Ruin(ed)\" adds a dash of hip-hop flavor with their beats and vocals. I\\'m not really familiar with Dismantled, but I wouldn\\'t mind auditioning other tracks based on what I heard here, despite the auto-tuney vocals.\\n\\nOverall, the mix of sounds isn\\'t too heavy in any one area.

With songs featuring Marty, Paul and Peter as leads showcasing their vocals, this is an interesting and well done effort released by Polydor. Marty Kristian of this group seems to be active in the sense of releasing as late as 2011 albums of demo recordings from the `1970's, available on the New Seekers web site. But for specific fans of Marty, this album features him as lead on 9 tracks, including the previously unreleased New Seekers Come Softly To Me, as well as the very impressive A Woman Grows, (which I'm surprised has not been picked up and recorded by others more recently in covers having a great deal of potential) written and sung as well as the more rocking A Midnight Woman. Indeed, Marty Kristian was and maybe still is not only a talented vocalist, but a very talented lyricists.

Now, Os Cemps, a very large group of musicians led by Oscar Fernndez, playing many forms of instruments, from the bagpipe to hurdy-gurdy to guitar to flutes to violins to various percussion, such as scrapers, tambourines, and drums, presents their fifth and best album, Tentemozo. The music, dance instrumentals and vocals, is bright and diverse in arrangements and moods. A blend of Celtic lilts and old Moorish elements, it reminds me of the music of Renaissance France's Provence. Here are ballads and rich, cheerful dances, such as a funny polka. The harmonies are thick and the beats are strong, producing alternating visions of courtly and festive village dances. The last track of the 42-minute long album excerpts a 1904 archived recording as introduction to a modern take of the song. In short, this album is filled with musical smiles.

But to merely label the Mommyheads as prog-pop does them a disservice, as there\\'s lots to explore here.  This is a rare album that has both instant accessibility and rewards for repeat-listeners, something for long-time fans and for those out there who might be saying \"The Mommy-whos?\"\\n\\n\"On A Clear Night\" kicks things off with a sparse, beautiful piano melody reminiscent of early Tony Banks.  Adam Elk\\'s vocals come in like a lullaby, and we think we know where this is going to take us, but then the drums and guitars kick in and we\\'re happily off in Mommyheads land, where music can be both poppy and experimental, daring and familiar.  This track links nicely with the following track, \"Gimme Silence\", continuing with a new piano theme, leading to a percussion and bass pattern that reminded me of Radiohead\\'s \"The Raindrops\" but with warmth and funk.  This takes us to the 6/4 beat \"Science and Reason\", showing that pop, rock and prog can peacefully coexist in the same track.  Next up is the epic, wonderful \"Medicine Show\", probably the album\\'s defining track, a fact that the Mommyheads have underscored by using part of the lyrics for the album\\'s title.  A lovely acoustic guitar and vocal melody gives way to thumping fuzz bass and layers of keyboards and vocals bordering on chaotic, but somehow the Mommyheads effortlessly steer us through it all and we\\'re happy to be along on the journey.\\n\\n \"My Intruder\" and \"Skinny White Uptight\" highlight the more abrasive side of the band, the former track with dark cynicism and the latter with self-effacing humor.  \"Devastate Me\" takes a sparse keyboard riff and puts some real bounce into it, \"Right Where They Should Be\" and \"Out on the Cliffs\" are classic Mommyheads.  \"Force of Will\" features a fun little keyboard trill that should sound dated but doesn\\'t.  \"Silent Age\" has a man-on-the-corner skiffle feel to it, and \"Bleed From a Glass\" ends on a subdued note, returning to the piano themes of the early tracks.  Bonus track \"No One Gives a Damn About Your Band\" comes off as fun rather than bitter, although god knows the Mommyheads have a right to be.  As a fan I will say it\\'s a shame that a Mommyheads masterpiece such as \"Hello Friends\" has a handful of views on YouTube while Train\\'s \"Soul Sister\" rakes in millions.  Both are good songs but the Mommyheads deserve their recognition too!\\n\\nOverall, I found \"Vulnerable Boy\" to be an ambitious, highly listenable mix.  In one sense, the first four tracks make up a complete \"suite\", and we\\'re left breathless and wanting more.  And while the rest of the tracks are fine (and at times, great), they lack some of the sonic majesty of those first four tracks.  I get the sense that they were really trying to stretch themselves in the front end of the album.  In particular \"Skinny White Uptight\" sticks out as not really belonging here, but damned if the track isn\\'t catchy.  And that\\'s one of the reasons I love the Mommyheads.  As soon as you try to define them or pigeonhole them, they say \"Wait, but what if we did this?\"  You end up getting the best of both worlds: invention and accessibility, in one great-sounding package.  I can\\'t wait to see what these guys do next.', 'summary': 'Pure prog-pop pleasure!', 'unixReviewTime': 1345420800, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 288}\n",

However, many also have a softer side to them. If you\\'re looking for a mostly heavy, upbeat, hard rockin\\' CD but enjoy a touch of softer songs, this CD is for you.\\n\\nContent-wise, their music is geared towards youth and young adults, however I (47) could also relate to many of their topics & themes. I especially liked \"Moment to Moment\" where he points out \"Every task before you is a challenge to succeed\"; that message is timeless no matter how old/young you are. Some of their songs are a little more nebulous than I like. My favorite song \"What About Justice\" sounds great, but I can\\'t quite figure out what it\\'s about. It may be clear to others, and it\\'s ok to have songs that have room for interpretation, but I like mine a little more straight forward. : )\\n\\nThe reason I didn\\'t give them 5 stars is that I like my Christian CDs to actually mention Jesus overtly at least a few times. To exclude the name of Jesus completely allows unbelievers or immature believers to hear the entire CD and never hear the name above all names, Jesus. To be sure, there are some Christian overtones & undertones in the CD, but this is part of the epidemic of CDs that don\\'t name Jesus even once: Third Day, \"Revelation\"; NeedToBreathe, \"The Outsiders\" & \"The Reckoning\"; Brit Nichole, \"The Lost Get Found\"; to name a very few.

It has a romantic and worthy history, being very much sui generis in content and theme, despite its partial indebtedness to Wagner, having had to be resurrected by the devotion of the composer\\'s friend, who reconstructed the score of Acts 1 and III from memory once they had been lost in a fire.\\n\\nMy problem is primarily with the lack of variety and the determined portentousness of the music itself. It is beautifully scored but so monochrome in mood that after the first fifteen minutes I found myself desperate for musical relief, which finally arrived in the shape of Jean-Luc Viala\\'s aria for the poet in paradise. For the most part, I can detect little in the way of shape or melody; the music meanders along aimlessly, shepherded by a succession of impressionistic gestures but remaining essentially moribund. It makes for a very long three hours. Of course, my reaction is very subjective and others seem to hear something I cannot, but nor can I say that the fairly simplistic human story, sandwiched between two Acts stuffed with allegorical characters representing various virtues and traits such as Truth, Goodness, Beauty and Suffering, really enthrals me; I prefer my moral attributes to be operatically enshrined in the depiction of real characters. Some might fairly condemn the libretto as more pretentious than anything Hofmannsthal and Strauss ever penned; certainly I\\'d prefer the dynamism and moral resonance of FROSCH any day.\\n\\nThe Wagnerian introduction is grand and slow-moving but hardly of a character to justify the conferring upon Magnard by some the title of \"the French Bruckner\"; his music is far more static and devoid of momentum. True, it shares a devotional ambience and a preponderance of massive blocks of polychromatic sound with minor key cadences and this quality is intensified by the resonant acoustic of the Toulouse recording venue: the Halle des Grains.\\n\\nMy other reservations centre upon the singing rather than the music itself. Not that Jos van Dam is anything other than vocally superb and commanding and my admiration extends to several other singers, including the intense, vibrant Hildegard Behrens and the rich, steady Nathalie Stutzmann. However, the other French lady singers in the cast, including those who impersonate the abstract beings and Nadine Denize are generally rather shrill and blowsy, while Gary Lakes\\' tenor is harsh and edgy. The choir, the Orfen Donostiarra, is decidedly inconsistent, with some squally sopranos and several instances of poor intonation throughout.\\n\\nAs French fin de sicle operas go, this one went; I would far prefer to champion the revival of Chausson\\'s \"Le roi Arthus\" than this lumbering and oh-so earnest work. I readily concede that others think differently but for all that I always wanted to like this opera, it left me bored.', 'summary': 'Interminable', 'unixReviewTime': 1349481600, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 344}\n",

Rahman is known as the Slumdog Millionaire composer. Danny Boyle used him once again for 127 Hours and he was able to prove that he is not just an \"Indian\" composer. People Like Us is indeed an interesting choice for the composer and he does indeed demonstrate a more mature and subtle side. People Like Us is writer Alex Kurtzman\\'s directorial debut, and he noted that music was a very important part of the film. Based off the score you can tell how integral the score is. The music is a very distinct narrative as the score flows in dramatic fashion with subtle character nuances and emotional beats.\\n\\nIt\\'s really tough to make a modern un-stylized drama score without being one-note and boring. This is a character drama that is solely about the characters and their lives. There is no crazy situations or aliens or anything for the music to absorb. The score absorbes the characters and Rahman is able to mold a very nice story of it. The score works as a whole piece and must be experiences as a full listen from beginning to end. There really aren\\'t any standout tracks that define the score. He introduces his central motif in the first track and that serves as the structure for the whole score\\'s soundscape. The piano and guitar are the most notably featured instruments and as naturally solo instruments they add a distinct human touch to the music. As we come to the end we wrap up the subtle journey in a heartwarming fashion. Everything works out at the end of this story and while some people may find that cliche and cheesy, it does leave you with a nice feeling inside.\\n\\nThe score is thoroughly enjoyable and does a lot by doing very little. The tone stays pretty much the same the whole way through, and that may be my only gripe. It rarely shifts into heavy emotional territory and because of that it\\'s hard to pick up the conflict of the story within the music. A.R. Rahman handles the whole thing very well and executes it with a uniformed touch. It may be too one-note at times, but the strength of the story in the music makes the characters very identifiable and it becomes a human story we can all feel.

Rahman\\'s more universal side.', 'summary': \"An Above Average Modern Drama Score That Shows Rahman's More Universal Side\", 'unixReviewTime': 1342483200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 371}\n",

Like \"Resonance,\" the music on \"Cycle\" is very soothing and relaxing ambient electronica. Although much of the music has a rather dark quality, it feels more like the darkness of infinite space or of nighttime than anything frightening or sad. It is interesting to note that Suzuki approaches his recordings in much the same way he approaches his paintings - one at a time, finishing one before moving on to the next, allowing the previous pieces to influence the ones that come next. Because of that, the album feels linear and plays as a continuous musical experience. Each of the eight tracks has been given an Episode number, leaving it up to the listener to discern what the music is \"about\" - if it is about anything specific at all. Suzuki uses a variety of keyboards and synthesizers to create this music, some of which are newer and some that are vintage. All of the Episodes have melodic passages as well as subtle rhythms and dynamics, and this music works equally well as a backdrop for quiet activities, music for relaxation, and music to get lost in. The sound quality is superb.\\n\\nBecause the continuity of the album causes it to play as one continuous piece, describing each track isn\\'t too useful.

To me, there seemed to be no forward momentum, general lack of development.  The title of this disc, \"Caught in Time\", is therefore apt.  So is the landscape cover-photo of an iceberg.\\n\\nOf course, then there is an exception.  Soundings II, as the composer says, is a study-work for the flute, providing a wide range of techniques to be practiced.  OK, that sounds like it would be a go-nowhere collection of study pieces.  But this piece seems to actually work.  To me, it appears to be a landscape study that unfolds the various moods and qualities that make a place unique and fulfilling to be in.  No, not much development, but interesting scene building.\\n\\nFour To Go, ok, that set of 4 pieces seemed to stagnate as well and have no cohesion.  These also seemed to be study pieces for an instrument, in this case a clarinet, but they did not build or develop.  This was more like naked displays of one technique after another, with little concern for momentum, cohesion, or the piece as a whole.  The third movement of the piece, Caught In Time (that\\'s the tempo instructions) is the namesake of the entire album.  And it does seem to be stuck in time, not in a good way.  The fourth and last movement, Relentlessly Yet Always Rockin\\' (again, the tempo instructions), was jazzy but so monotonous.  So \"Four to Go\" seemed to have it\\'s title not in a good way.  Sort of like \"Hang in there, you just have four to go!\"\\n\\nAnd on and on the disk goes, with \"Percorsi d\\'anima\", Incroci\", and \"Quattro chaicchiere ed un apertivo\", the third of which presents a jazzy riff that reminds one of Charlie Brown music or Claude Bolling; in other words, derivative, a cliche.\\n\\nIn the last set, \"Three Songs on the Poetry of Yeats\", the music serves as the accompaniment to the voice line, and was more satisfying than the previous works.  It then struck me that this was the issue with all the pieces, save the first: they were an accompaniment to nothing, needing a lead line to get them \"unstuck\".', 'summary': 'Caught in Time, Stuck in Neutral', 'unixReviewTime': 1351123200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 412}\n",

On Idol, her recordings of \"Give in to Me,\" \"I Can\\'t Make You Love Me,\" and \"Cry Baby\" (to name a few) are pure and magical, with an undeniable raw rock edge.

In fact, her voice is mostly unrecognizable. Even on songs like \"Scars,\" which is very vocal-centered without a lot of instrumentation, Allison has obviously been instructed to sing in an unnatural way, and her near-a cappella voice sounds contrived.\\n\\nShame on you, Allison, for allowing this to happen.

I prefer it to even that of Glenn Gould. So, this is not only a five-star performance, but amongst the very finest that exist, and the best that I know of. The merits of the performance are already well-known, so there does not seem any real purpose in giving such a fabulous and well-known performance a star rating. Rather, the purpose of this particular release is its transfer to SACD, apparently directly from the master tapes ... which brings one to the sonics.\\n\\nThese recordings were made in analogue in 1970 -1973 on a Bosendorfer at Schlo&szlig; Klesheim in Salzburg ... tuned about a half-semitone higher than normal pitch. They have always had an unusual resonant sonic ... I have seen others who have complained about it ... but I have always found the sound quite ethereal, and rather well-suited to Herr Bach. So what does SACD do for it?\\n\\nThe answer is .... odd things. The sound on my original redbook CD release is more raw, more natural, and oddly closer to a natural piano sound than the SACD release. The SACD version sound is sometimes clear, and sometimes muted, and it has unusual piano harmonics. Sometimes, the voicing of parts seems peculiar, or that something is missing. Or sometimes it seems that one part (usually in the mid-range) has unusual clarity, but the other parts are out of balance. The bass line is often emaciated. I couldn't understand this. Then, I listened with headphones ... and I noticed that whereas the original CD version is VERY hissy (unpleasantly so with headphones, but perfectly fine listening with speakers), the SACD version with headphones has almost no hiss whatsoever. And that, I suspect, is the clue to the problem. This is not just a raw transfer from the original analogue tapes to DSD ... Rather, it has been de-greased, wiped with disinfectant, anti-mould and decongestant. To my ears, it sounds rather like the dubious EMI re-releases onto SACD: something that has been so severely over-processed, nuked and radiated ... that the sound has become 'weird'.\\n\\nFor standard stereo loudspeaker listening, I much prefer my original redbook CD version: the CD version is vastly more natural and more balanced. For headphone listening, I do find the hiss of the original CD a problem, but I am not sure I would want the weird sonics of the SACD version either. Overall then, the SACD version is sadly disappointing. If you do not already have this set, I would go for the standard CD version: far less expensive, and far superior.\\n\\nPresentation: 4 green Martian discs nicely presented in a standard 4-box CD case. The green SACDs are similar to those used in single-layer SHM-SACDs, but these are hybrids. The artwork design very nicely matches the original CD release I have.

Quick Lesson: An arrangement is the adaptation of a previously written musical composition for presentation. It may differ from the original form by reharmonization, paraphrasing or development of the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure. (Thanks Wikipedia) So by that definition, that is not what this album is because it does none of those things; and yet it says 'Arrange Album' on the cover.\\n\\nSo what is this CD then? It is merely an upgrading of the original synthesized music, with newer synthesized music. The result: the same arrangements as the original, with better quality. In fact, when I first listened to it, I couldn't tell a difference. That is until I compared it to the original soundtrack, then I could hear the far better quality and better synth.\\n\\nHere's why I'm on the fence: there are only 16 tracks on this CD. When you arrange a soundtrack this is understandable. You take a selection of tracks and arrange them, bringing new life to the songs. So in doing this, its reasonable to do a handful of songs from the original soundtrack. However, if your merely upgrading the sound, then why not upgrade all 44 tracks from the original soundtrack? Then that would make this a worthy purchase. After all, Secret of Mana had some beautiful melodies and really deserved one or the other. But this album is neither a true arranged album, nor a fully improved soundtrack. It's more of a sampling on what Secret of Mana could have sounded like if it was better synthesized.\\n\\nSong List:\\n\\n1. Genesis ~ Fear of the Heavens - 1:41\\n\\n2.

I mean, there are a lot more girls (women) in extreme metal now than ever.  I mean Jo Bench is the longest running, having been Bolt Thrower\\'s bassist for about 25 years or so. This lady, Mallika Sundaramurthy, is just beyond finding anything wrong with her performance.  If you do, you\\'re looking WAY too freaking hard, really. She is perfect for this.

With the 2012 release of the marvellously titled \\'Stories For Watering Skies\\' Vanessa and her O\\'s (Andreas Mattsson and Markus Jagerstedt this time round no James Iha or Niclas Frisk it seems) prove that the critically acclaimed debut was no flash in the pan and this second album is another classic in the making.\\n\\nFrom the intriguingly eye catching pop art sleeve to the opening song \\'Any Given Monday\\' you immediately get a sense that The O\\'s care, maybe that\\'s why it\\'s taken so long but straight off we are on familiar territory but with a new twist. Into track 2 \\'Sweet Nothing\\' and you already know this band have not let you down and that here is another gem to be cherished and played over and over again as the debut album demanded to be and so it proves.\\nYes, by the time you get to the more French electro pop of \\'L\"Air Entre Nous\\' you have already been taken on a melodic and emotional journey only 5 tracks into the record! We are hooked in once again by Vanessa\\'s healing sensual voice drifting effortlessly between french and english with those to die for melodies and that layered, rich and dreamy production we have come to expect. It\\'s all here,  losing nothing of the song craft or dextrous musicianship of the debut album, not at all, it\\'s all there just as i hoped and dreamed it would be... even without the talent of a certain James Iha this time round.. although Mr Iha has doffed his cap to the O\\'s by releasing his own version of The O\\'s track \\'Till Next Tuesday\\' on his new album \\'Look To The Sky\\', another fine album to savour if you haven\\'t already.\\n\\nLa Ballade d\\'O was my unexpected album of the century, Stories For Watering Skies had a big responsibility on it\\'s shoulders to follow it, I didn\\'t think it could possibly be improved upon but I can say now as I discover this album more and more the impossible is achieved.\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/La-Ballade-d-O/dp/B000FBIYMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">La Ballade d\\'O</a>', 'summary': \"Wow! swedish French alt popsters Vanessa & the O's release fabulous new album!\", 'unixReviewTime': 1350864000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 525}\n",

There is no comparison other than the projects sharing the metal universe. The first track, Exit Wounds, pretty much sets the stage for the EP and gives a great idea of what to expect for the next 16 minutes - and that is well-rounded, solid metal that courts hard rock.\\n\\nThe pacing of the EP stays relatively even until a brief break in tempo with Crush. As bands with excellent singers tend to do, the tempo is eased a bit and we get treated to something more along the lines of a ballad. But don't let me ruin the song for you with a boring step-by-step breakdown - just check it out. Depending on your tastes, I doubt you'll be disappointed.\\n\\nIf you're looking for something that isn't ear-blisteringly loud and powerful with four-and-a-half million BPM and is just good music, you could do a lot worse than chucking four bones at this album.\", 'summary': 'Metal courting hard rock.

Prior to this, Pappy distributed Bally jukeboxes until WWII shut down production, then he opened a record shop; Jack was a nightclub operator and talent agent. STARDAY, a combination of their last names, grew out of Pappy\\'s wholesale record distributorship. Their earliest waxings were made in Jack\\'s home studio. George Jones was the first of many consistent hit-makers to join the label.\\n\\nAfter Don Pierce invested in the company in \\'53, STARDAY relocated to L.A. Around that time, Jack sold his shares to his partners. In \\'57 there was another move to Madison, TN. A year later Pierce bought out Pappy entirely.

As the story goes, McCartney had dreamt the music to \"Yesterday\" and woke up coming up with the first thing he could to keep the tune going:  \"Scrambled Eggs, oh my baby how I love your legs.\"  The song existed as such for weeks until he was sure he didn\\'t plagiarize the music from someone else.  At that point, the proper lyrics were written and history was made.\\n\\nAlmost fifty years later, the idea was revisited with Paul\\'s appearance on Jimmy Fallon\\'s show and additional lyrics were written under the original vein.  Paul even managed to work in a somewhat awkward vegitarian plug with the almost sung verse on chicken wings.\\n\\nIt\\'s fun, strange, and unique.

Excellent songs, excellent album production. The songs are very singable and meaningful.\\n\\nYou can stream the entire album at [...]\\n\\nNotes:\\nOne aim of this album was to introduce some new songs that churches in Scotland might find useful in their own unique worship services. Scottish traditional music and folk melodies have an adaptable quality that renders the best of them timeless. Paraphrases from the Scottish Psalter like Psalm 23 have been sung across the world for centuries, and it's important to remind new generations that these ancient words of scripture remain profoundly relevant. Scottish writers like Horatius Bonar and James Montgomery showed that a wealth of transforming biblical truths could be taught and absorbed through songs, so we also wanted to introduce examples of their lyrics to new listeners.\\n\\nThe motivation for making this hymns recording did not spring simply from a desire to create art. Hymnwriting is about making music firstly out of gratitude to Jesus Christ. With all our imperfections and limitations, Christians struggle to express anything more than an echo of His greatness, but we believe that this is a thing eminently worth sharing. For the person who finds this idea strange, it will hopefully make more sense as you listen! Our hope is that every listener might hear the joy that comes from the gospel: the good news of God's saving and transforming love, made available to every person through his son, Jesus.\\n\\nABOUT NEW SCOTTISH ARTS\\nNew Scottish Arts is an arts outreach & education ministry. Our purpose is to serve the Christian community in Scotland by enabling Christians to share their faith through the creative arts, by facilitating vibrant outreach events and projects that will impact on local communities and the whole of Scotland.\", 'summary': 'excellent songs & production', 'unixReviewTime': 1358380800, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 683}\n",

Mega Man II was released in 1988 and the soundtrack is still one of the most creative, catchy, and inspiring (provided you are a musician or if you are working out) pieces of work and the Bit Brigade revised and polished it from an 8-bit composition to a real live rock/metal sound.

So, to you, prospective listener, I ask you this:\\n\\nBefore you hit play, you need to take a deep breath, and treat this as something exclusive from all other works.  It is not, in any way similar to not only those styles, but the emotions evoked.  It is an entirely different animal-- no, it's an entirely different species; life form, maybe.  This, to some, should come as no surprise.\\n\\nWhat we have here is something that's not necessarily 'powerful' in the sense that a listener would be used to-- you have to hunt for it, a bit.  If you're an audiophile like I consider myself, this should come as no surprise.  Good music grows on you-- sometimes like a sickness, sometimes like a deep, profound joy.  This album kind of did both.\\n\\nThere is definitely something altogether eclectic and strange about Scheidt's lyrical presence in this record-- his first two tracks have sparse instrumentals, and mainly focus on him setting the stage for this emotional journey.  He constructs, presents, and confronts-- although a bit abstractly- a lineup of his own demons, and kills them systematically with kindness, joy, love, and pure emotional vulnerability.  It's alien flower-power, but it also displays exactly where one would imagine Scheidt's soul to reside-- and this is what I think separates Scheidt's vision from a good lot of other artists and musicians: Scheidt's biggest weapon (and in Yob, too) is his ability to turn anything into lead.  His airy, shy vocals in this album give way sometimes and the sheer profundity of the narrative is a bit staggering at times.  Some won't like this style from Scheidt, some will be indifferent, and others will accept it with, just as he presents it, open arms.\\n\\nI find myself having a difficult time quantifying this album-- I don't think it should be critiqued the way that other albums so helplessly rise and fall.  It's designed to be intimate-- to be personal, so while I have an idea of how I would, hypothetically, quantify it, I'm going to leave it at a 4 star rating, not because it's good or great or, but because it asks to be heard in such a way that I think anything less wouldn't be doing Scheidt any justice.\", 'summary': 'Doom metal Juggernaut shows awkward, softer side', 'unixReviewTime': 1350432000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 739}\n",

This is Rokke\\'s third CD to date, following \"Joy,\" a Christmas collection, and \"Tell the Story,\" a collection of hymns, both released in 2009. A longtime music educator, church musician, and the wife and daughter of Lutheran pastors, Ms Rokke brings a lifetime of musical experience to her recordings. She has played the piano for many, many weddings over the years, and this collection is made up of favorites that she has used as preludes, postludes, processionals, and recessionals. Several of the pieces are very standard wedding faire - Wagner\\'s \"Bridal Chorus\" (often referred to as \"Here Comes the Bride\"), Mendelssohn\\'s \"Wedding March,\" and the venerable Pachelbel\\'s \"Canon in D,\" but there is also an assortment of other wedding-appropriate classical music that isn\\'t nearly as commonly heard. Along with being a very warm and pleasant CD to listen to, \"Wedding Classics\"  provides brides and wedding planners a one-stop sampler of music to choose from for that special day. The liner notes of the CD also give a brief but informative history of each piece and its composer. The CD contains a bonus track, \"Prelude In a Classic Style\" by Gordon Young, a contemporary composer who passed away in 1998. Several of these pieces were originally composed for organ or for orchestra, and Ms Rokke has arranged those for piano solo. The composers represented are Henry Purcell, George F. Handel (2), JS Bach (5), Charles Gounod, Richard Wagner, Claude Debussy (2), Gordon Young, Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Pachelbel, Cesar Franck, Jeremiah Clarke, and Edvard Grieg. My own favorites include Handel\\'s \"Thanks Be To Thee,\" Bach\\'s \"Cello Suite #1,\" Debussy\\'s \"Reverie,\" Young\\'s \"Prelude In Classic Style,\" Bach\\'s \"Arioso,\" Franck\\'s \"Panis Angelicus,\" and Grieg\\'s \"Wedding Day At Troldhaugen.\"\\n\\nThis album makes for very pleasant listening and is a handy tool for selecting music for a wedding.', 'summary': 'From MainlyPiano', 'unixReviewTime': 1340409600, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 746}\n",

It started in the `60s, really, with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and then the Americans, Mike Bloomfield, Ry Cooder, Johnny Winter. The 70s gave us Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Santana, Duane Allman, the 80s Mark Knopfler and so on. Kenny Wayne Shepard, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and many more have come on the scene since. It\\'s an attractive niche to try and fit into. It has so much room to shine. And it is easy to fail; get lost in the crowd. There\\'s the whole \"cross roads\" myth about having to sell your soul to really be granted that extra something that it takes to be the next Jimi Hendrix, the next Robert Johnson.\\n\\nDave Fields is in the new crop and he just may have it. Hi third album,  Detonation, explodes with a harder rocking sound drenched in many a variety of styles touching on classic rock , jazz-blues and reggae mixed in with a blast of blinding blues that pays tribute, most notably to Beck and Hendrix with nods to Buddy Guy (especially in those passages where the notes fly off his ax like shrapnel in the middle of soulful songs).\\n\\nFrom the first notes of the opening song, \"Addicted To Your Fire\" (which you\\'d have to be blind or deaf not to recognize Hendrix \"Stand Next To You Fire\" in) it is apparent that he is setting the bar at Jimi height.\\n\\nFields explores 1960s psychedelia on \"Prophet in Disguise,\" a melodic track with an Eastern-influenced guitar lick that is more David Gilmour than George Harrison. Track three is a favorite. \"Doin Hard Time,\" is slow, smoldering blues duet with Grammy Award Winning blues singer and guitarist,  Joe Louis Walker that works very well. Track five is a fun song, \"Bad Hair Day,\" is an interesting mix of reggae and the blues, vowing not to let his hair get him down.\\n\\nOn \"Better Be Good\" you can hear him channeling SRV to good effect. It delivers some social commentary and his guitar is at the best here as he pulls everything out of his bag of tricks. The purest blues tune on the album is probably \"Pocket Full Of Dust\", The guitar attacks and it stings. It\\'s soaked in blues soul ala Buddy Guy and the great Chicago stylists. The organ of Vladimir Barsky works well behind his guitar explosions and drummer Kenny Soule and bassist Andy Huenerberg round out his band quite well.\\n\\nDetonation is produced by David Z (Prince, Johnny Lang, Etta James, Buddy Guy) and  is a 12-song exploration of Fields\\'  electrifying guitar prowess. This album has the feel of Fields stepping out of the pure blues spot light and expanding his sound into more rock, but he never, like all the greats before him, completely abandons the blues, instead he has absorbed them and is ready to let the blues be his foundation for what he creates from here on out.\\n\\nThe Dirty Lowdown', 'summary': 'Dave Fields is in the new crop of blues guiatrists and he just may have it', 'unixReviewTime': 1350259200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 839}\n",

This is a great album for the Punjabi music industry, it breaks traditional norms with new styles of tracks, but most tracks fail to be melodious and catchy. Shinda\\'s albums have always been melodious and catchy, which is why his song \"Khushiyaan\" from his most successful album Balle is now immortalized as a MUST PLAY at any wedding/party.

You can listen to this from beginning to end. All songs are obviously Christian, as opposed to just inspirational. I\\'m not opposed to inspirational, it\\'s just not what I\\'m looking for right now.\\n\\nThe album starts off with \"Faith,\" which is an upbeat anthem. The repetition of Phillipians 4:13 \"I Can Do All Things Through Christ Who Strengthens Me\" makes this a soul stirring piece that would be perfect for working out or finding encouragement. It features rapper Conscience, who sounds like he\\'s channeling Outkast, in a good way.\\n\\nThe second song, \"Can\\'t Have My Soul\" is one of my favorites. It also provides a mantra, \"You Can\\'t Have My Soul.\" I\\'m crazy about the beat, which is both old school and completely new at the same time. This song\\'s message is about fighting temptation and not conforming to the world. A simple song, it touches on complicated topics like abortion.\\n\\nNext is another favorite \"Love is All.\" This is also included in the Eutopian Remix album, and it is an awesome song in both applications. This sounds like it could be a Toby Mac song, honestly. I love TobyMac, so it\\'s not an insult at all. This song isbased on 1 Corinthians 13, or the \"love texts.\" It\\'s about loving the people in the world, even if they do you wrong.\\n\\nWe move on to \"Boom Shaka Loka\" which I personally think is a filler song. No real message, this what I call a \"get Christian crunk\" song. It\\'s just about dancing and encouraging. The hook is \"I\\'m on top of the world and I can\\'t come down.\" It basically saying the world can\\'t touch you. It\\'s like CatchAFire by Tobymac. Doesn\\'t really make sense, it\\'s more about the feeling of the music. Not a favorite, but I like it okay.\\n\\nI love the lyrics of the 5th song \"Hot X Cold.\" It\\'s about making a decision in your life to serve God and warning against being a lukewarm Christian. The same \"don\\'t let the world have your soul\" message continues here.\\n\\nThe mood completely switches on \"In Your Hands.\" This is more Christian contemporary; its the most traditional song on the entire album. It\\'s a praise song, and it\\'s good, but forgettable.\\n\\n\"Whoa Whoa Yeah Yeah\" has the catchiest, simplest hook; I found myself singing it under my breath after one of my first listens to the entire album. This is about proclaiming your trust in the Lord. It\\'s the perfect ending to an album entitled \"Faith.\"\\n\\nThough I may not be crazy about every single song, this is one of few albums that I can let ride without skipping a track. It\\'s really good, the sound is different, the beats and production are good, and the lyrics are timely.

They combine an accessible, retro, pre-hardcore punk sound with island vibes, folk-rock and a gritty New Jersey demeanour. They\\'re worldly and wordy, with plenty to say, but seem perfectly comfortable with the concept of big pop songs. Songwriters Adam \"Devil Hands\" Falzer and Alan \"Sucia\" Smith bring a wealth of experience to the project. Falzer\\'s studied Music Synthesis at Berklee School of Music, he sings, produces and plays lead guitar. Smith sings and strums an acoustic guitar, and enjoys making things out of poo and straw - houses I think, rather than boiled sweets. Drummer Jonathon Riordan and bass player Gerry Griffin complete the line-up.\\n\\nAs far as I can ascertain \"The Baby Album\" is the band\\'s third long-player, which they begin with \"Friends in the Underground\". It chugs along like a well-bred Dead Boys\\' number, with just enough sneer on the vocals and what sounds like a saxophone solo - and it\\'s catchy as hell. \"Tooty Tooty Ta\" is a Cracker-esque tree huggers call to arms that alternates between ramshackle country rock and rickety indie-cowpunk. Again, you will sing-a-long. \"Make a Wish\" reveals a Caribbean bent and \"Zombie Jesus\" won\\'t makes friends amongst the faithful. \"Frankly, You Can Thank Me\" sounds like a title Morrissey might have come up with, but it\\'s nothing like a Smiths song. Instead it unwinds like a folky-post-punk Chili Peppers and I like it a lot. So a smorgasbord of sounds, styles and influences, yet it all comes together.

No other band, other than maybe the Pet Shop Boys, can do this and have it be authentic. A love letter to the music fan (take a really good look at the cover) in all of us, WAM does, indeed, sound like Saint Etienne, but a Saint Etienne that is still willing to take risks.\\n\\nIf you're a fan of SE then you should find this to be at the very least a good album (some here have not, and that's OK, they're entitled), and I expect it would also be a pretty good starting point for the un-initiated to get an idea of Latter Day Saint Etienne. Still dance oriented, still heart wrenching, still relevant.\\n\\nLastly, the 2cd deluxe editions of these fairly recent reissues are pretty much uniformly excellent. The 2nd discs of supplemental material is far from scraping the bottom of the barrel in most cases. The 2nd disc here is more interesting than essential, though, and probably the least essential other than the Underworld and Andrew Weatherall mixes.

Maybe the fact that they have taken just too long between their last album and this one, the creative juices have run dry. I understand people\\'s comments about \"good writing\", however I don\\'t agree with them about being good songs. Songs appeal to people by the way they are performed on the disc, the production, and the actual quality of the melody. Since I am not a poet, I don\\'t give that much importance to words, just as long as they are not as stupid and repeated as what you would find on an ELO album. I love Foxbase alpha, the remix foxbase beta, finisterre and good humor. Some of their singles compilations have excellent material as well as well recorded B-side fillers, which come off as charming. However on this album, I hear a tired band, just recording an album as an excuse for a tour. This is not even an attempt to SOUND like Saint Etienne. Here they sound like any other overproduced indie band with the volume set to \"too loud\" when the album was mastered. There is not even an audiophile element here. It is all loud drum machines, synthesizers and fake guitars. This album and Metallica\\'s \"Death Element\" (2008) are irrefutable evidence the Loudness Wars have claimed Saint Etienne as yet another victim. Also, there are too many writers and producers, which yield at best, a mediocre b-side compilation album. And I bought this album on LP form, so it hurt my pocket even more. I sold the album to a used record store and used the credit to but something else instead.', 'summary': \"Well's run dry.

I paused to listen because it sounded like days of old. I am a 42 year old man who began to fall in love with New Wave music in 1979. This exploded throughout the early 80\\'s and through my teen years. I was attracted to the vast style and subject that New Wave and Classic Alternative provided. I loved the sound of the original analog synthesizers and the non-traditional chord changes and progressions, and the endless variety of unique voices and found sounds. In the early 90\\'s music was destroyed by Grunge and all of the other forgettable dreck that was being pumped out. Digital synthesizers even made electronic music boring. I was both disappointed and offended that the music that I loved so much was gone. I took time in the 90\\'s to research and discover a vast array of lesser known Alternative artists from the 80\\'s, and was able to expand my knowledge and collection extensively, but there\\'s still only so far you can go.\\n\\nAbout a month ago, I kept hearing a quirky song that sounded like it came out of 1981 art school. I finally found someone who knew the name of the song and it turned out to be \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" by Gotye. I don\\'t pay attention to modern music so the only time I hear something is in passing. But sometimes things seem meant to be. Even though that song hit about a year ago, it just now came to my attention for a reason, and I was very excited by it. Even the music video had a retro flavor, ala Visage \"Fade to Grey\". By listening to The Chevin perform \"Champion\", I was startled, speechless, and very excited. When the broadcast was over I immediately went to YouTube and watched the music video. The most appropriate way to describe the song is breathtakingly stunning! I literally had tears in my eyes at how powerful this song is, and the retro style cannot be denied. I immediately thought of very early Simple Minds and very early U2. I played the video over and over and continued to have the same reaction, which I don\\'t think I\\'ve had in countless years. The video also had some retro flavor in the form of several slow motion scenes and a lot of blank white background. All they needed to be totally early 80\\'s was to shoot it on soft focus videotape, as opposed to film.\\n\\nI looked up The Chevin on iTunes and found the \"Champion\" ep. I bought it, both on iTunes and on CD from Amazon UK because I love physical product, despite my reliance on my iPod. I just like to hold the item in my hand. I guess that\\'s retro in itself. I see the band have a full length album titled \"Borderland\" coming soon. I listened to the samples and heard many other sounds, styles and structures that I fell in love with all those years ago, and that should have never gone away. I will snap up this album on release and will pay very close attention to what this exciting, young band produce in the future. There is something very exciting mixing around in music lately, and I need to start randomly exploring so I don\\'t miss out on any other new talent who may be paying overdue homage to the pioneers from decades ago. I never thought I\\'d be able to say it but after hearing The Chevin, I\\'ve fallen in love again.', 'summary': \"Yesterday today. New love and discovery.

The duet has just released their third CD, Down South, following last year\\'s CD, Nuthin\\'.  This takes the duet back to their deep Southern roots and the outcome is a disc that is beautifully harmonious, and chock full of southern musical hospitality.\\n\\nStuddard says of the album, \"Down South came out of a bunch of things I remember about growing up in middle Georgia.  The things my parents would say; the things I was expected to do or not do.  It\\'s very autobiographical.  The motivation for most of these songs came from personal experiences. It\\'s a complicated word and we tend to only complicate it more most of the time, which makes for lots of good material to write about.\"\\n\\nAll of the nine tunes on Down South are great.  Three randomly picked Boomerocity favorites are:\\n\\nThe opening cut, Loving You.  Beautifully written, performed and recorded, this song is worthy of national radio play as well as some close attention by the country cable TV networks.  Yeah, it\\'s that good.\\n\\nA second randomly picked favorite is This Time Tomorrow.  Slow, bluesy, and just a little bit funky, this tune is worth multiple slaps of the repeat button.\\n\\nThe closing tune, Lullabye, is beautiful in its sentimentality, tugging at the heart strings of both the performers and the listener.  How many of us parents have said words like those written in this song as we sung our kids to sleep?\\n\\nIf you love great, smooth, easy listening, Southern grown music sung from the soul, then you will definitely want to get your copy of Down South by Bedhed and Blondy.

Some releases take more than 3 listens to fully digest, and some are so good that I end up listening to them more because I just do not get a chance to review the CD quickly enough. Every now and again you come across a CD that it is a challenge to listen three times. UUVVWWZ's S/T CD is one of those CDs. It starts out pretty solid. Berry Can is a good song. Shark Suit is above average, but once you reach Jap Dad you notice that UUVVWWZ has Spastic even annoying tendencies. The CD begins to go down hill fast. Neolao is pointlessly long, and resembles a poor imitation of The Doors meets early Zeppelin. Castle is annoying and too long. Green Starred Sleeve is the worst song on the CD. The guitar work seems to be purposefully irritating and the vocals sound like meandering pretentiousness. Trapezeus is an attempt at rock and roll, but again the vocals KILL anything that might be considered redeeming. Finally, The Sun is irritating and Hum Jam shows that the band is capable of better work than they put forth on the rest of the CD.\\n\\nThe Major problem with UUVVWWZ is the vocals. Teal Gardner, the lead singer, refuses to control her voice. She needs to understand her vocal limitations and work within them. Unlike some artists, that she most probably idolizes, when she pushes herself beyond them the results are not appealing. If this band could reel themselves in they could probably put together a solid rock CD.\\n\\nThe song by song review is 49%, but when you factor in how inconsistent and annoying the CD is overall the review comes to 41%..\\n\\nSimilar Artists/Influences- Sonic Youth, Portugal The Man, Beep Beep, Broken Spindles, Pylon, Deerhoof, Opium Taylor, The Lepers, The Birthday Party, Captain Beefheart, Make Believe, Friend/Enemy, Blatz, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Jefferson Airplane\", 'summary': 'An Experimental album gone terribly wrong', 'unixReviewTime': 1264550400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1183}\n",

Indeed, I find his voice more enjoyable than that of his father, the late Salamat Ali Khan. At age 12, Shafqat Ali Khan was given the title of ustad, master. Accompanied by tabla, harmonium, sarangi, and tanpura drone, the various Sufi songs and ragas (Bharvi, Piloo, Yaman Kalyan, Bhutyar) are powerfully performed. The recording is engineered bright with a sense of being in large open chamber. Listening intently to Khan\\'s artistry in the thumri, the semi-classical form, and the serious pure raga style, I was struck by his control and crisp ornamentation. These are strong, emotional pieces yet meditative in effect. Afterwards, I seem to move as if in a dance. This is an excellent recording that may surprise even those unfamiliar with classical Indian vocal forms.\\n\\nThe first bonus track is a poem by Hafiz sung by Zohreh Jooya and an Irani ensemble; the second bonus, while also related to Sufism, is by the Glizar Turkish Music Ensemble.

It doesn't have the drive that she had in some of her past songs like It's Like That and Honey from Butterfly.

The last decade has seen her career turn to farce, somehow reconvene for a financially successful, if not musically mediocre period in Mariah\\'s career. She was hit hard by the failure of \"Glitter\", it\\'s soundtrack album, as well as her subsequent 2002 studio effort \"Charmbracelet\". She rebounded in 2005 with \"Emancipation\" and though she produced some memorable hits \"We Belong Together\" and \"Shake It Off\" being notable, I feel that vocally, Carey peaked sometime around 2000. I have always loved Mariah Carey, but as the years go on, I don\\'t feel that she is bringing the same vocal efforts she used to. Her singing is much more breathy and whispery. It irritates me sometimes.\\n\\nPost \"Emancipation..\" Carey released two more Studio albums and her 2nd christmas album. All of which were middle of the road efforts in terms of critical and commerical performance. My favorite song from this period would be her single \"Obsessed\" which became something of a surprise hit on radio stations across the country. In spite of this, over the years I went from being a diehard Mariah fan to pretty casual, as I have always felt that she could do much better things in music right now than she is doing.\\n\\n\"Triumphant (Get \\'Em)\" has clear potential. A song about overcoming and looking towards brighter days. Who doesn\\'t like that? The issue (for me anyways) is the fact that the whole act is getting a little played out. Mariah as a 21-st Century R&B Diva meets Ghetto diva is the same thing I have seen and heard on her last 3 albums. And the thing that makes this track even sadder is that at some points, she almost sounds like a guest on her own song. Rick Ross just kinda takes over in sections and it takes away from Mariah as well. Add in barely-there vocals and a lackluster, heard-it-before-ready-made hip hop beat circa 2007, it basically is a recipie for disaster. Her promotion of the single hasn\\'t blown me away either. Her live performance of the song at Rockerfeller Center was terrible and very breathy. It was again all about Rick Ross. The studio version was better than the live, but not by much. Sometimes I just can\\'t even understand what she is saying at all!!!!\\n\\nThe song has not done well on the charts. It peaked at 115 on Billboard (didnt make hot 100, slipped off after 3 weeks, and barely made it onto the r&b charts at 97, for a very brief stay as well.) The bad news is this single is pretty much critical and commercial toast. Hopefully she hasn\\'t finished her album yet and maybe will retool and tinker with a few things. Or she may just release another obligatory disc of crap. After all, she is a new judge on American Idol, so she\\'s gonna be paid either way.

The beat wasn\\'t too bad and then... she started singing and the music no longer covered up the vocals.\\n2. Finally Getting Up From Rock Bottom: The beat again, wasn\\'t that bad and then... she started singing... with autotune. Oh the humanity. I think she was mentioning sitting in traffic on the highway. I normally don\\'t condone doing such things but if she feels so inclined...\\n3. The Sunshine State: She opened up with her autotune. I\\'m not sure what she was saying. I think I heard \"Short\". Yeah, I don\\'t know what to tell ya. At this point I must puke because it\\'s just bad....\\n.... alright I\\'m back.\\n4. Unplanned Parenthood: She opens up saying \"Oh baby, Oh baby\" in autotune. I\\'m pretty sure that she\\'s autotunning about parenthood and being by herself a single parent (although seriously... she doesn\\'t have it that rough) poor thing is having to change diapers (I caught that much in the song).\\n5. Searching for Closure: Surely this isn\\'t too bad. It starts off with some rain and piano. Yes, a glimmer of hope. It\\'s not too bad.... uh oh.. here comes the autotune talking.. not even singing. *Face/palm*\\n6. Caught in the Act: Oh really really bad autotune and oh.. oh is that dubstep... yes. And now some REALLY bad autotune. I think she should be more worried about being caught in stupidity.\\n7. The Phone Call That Changed My Life: It starts off with \"You can only put so much in a song\". Yes and what you decided to put in every song is autotune. Have I said how much it sucks? Yeah this song sucks too.\\n8. With Out This Ring: Again, starting with Autotune... talking. The beats not entirely bad though.\\n9. After Prom: So this gem starts off w/ \"shhh don\\'t tell don\\'t let it get out\". Not sure what she doesn\\'t want getting out. It should have been this album.\\n10. Liar Liar: ... aaaaand more autotune with the same words she says over and over again. What she\\'s saying... I don\\'t know.\\n11. On My Own: bla bla bla autotune bla bla music sucks bla\\n\\nSo the long short of it is.. this album sucks big time. Like a super drunk Paris Hilton who got ahold of the autotune app on her phone and decided to go to town on a severely offbeat rant about her \"struggles\" in life... such is this album.

There is a distinct effort to write catchier and more accessible tunes with a very modern slant to it. The song \"Share Your Energy\" even boasts some metalcore type of backing vocals which actually detract from the composition rather than contribute to it. \"Kingdom of Sand\" consists of industrial sound effects with awful pop vocals and watery guitar leads. The guitars no longer cut through the mix as they used to; the riffs are puny and lifeless. Vocals are delivered in a very direct manner, gone are the piercing screams balanced by clean and throaty vocal passages. Andersson actually sounds like he delivers the verses in a boring monotone. The choruses that defined this band\\'s sound are gone, and the instrumental parts sound terribly weak, especially the guitar leads. When the vocals do hit centre-stage on songs like \"Seen It All Before\" or \"Your Desire,\" they sound so different not even a die-hard fan would know it\\'s the same band that wrote and released their prior work. The only song that resembles their earlier body of work is \"Voyager 9.\" It sounds like a leftover from their earlier sessions due to its blend of fiery lead work with powerful vocals and complex arrangements.\\n\\nThink of this album much like Evergrey\\'s&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Monday-Morning-Apocalypse/dp/B000ELL7K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Monday Morning Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;and you should be able to imagine how much of a departure it is from their core sound. I\\'m all for progression and growth, but once the \\'new era\\' of a band severs all ties with their core identity (blending industrial sounds with so-called aggressive vocals buried under plodding drum and bass with almost inaudible guitar work -- all within painfully predictable song structures), chances are the band is now aiming at a different audience, which seems to be exactly the case here.', 'summary': 'Disappointing to say the least', 'unixReviewTime': 1346716800, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1337}\n",

Nina\\'s piano work is an added bonus. Listen to the sound samples and decide for yourself.\\n\\nAll of Nina\\'s tracks were from the December 1957 session that produced her debut album titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Little-Girl-Blue-Remastered/dp/B00E7NIT5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Little Girl Blue (Remastered)</a>.

She is backed on the tracks on this album by Jimmy Bond on bass and Al \\'Tootie\\' Heath on drums.\\n\\nCarmen McRae\\'s tracks were all recorded in NYC on October 6, 1954. She is backed by an ensemble comprised of Herbie Mann on flute and tenor sax, Mat Mathews on accordion, Mundell Lowe on guitar, Wendell Marshall on bass and Kenny Clarke on drums.\\n\\nFor Chris Connor the tracks were recorded in separate sessions in August 1954. Try a little tenderness and What is There to Say were recorded in NYC on August 9 and 11, 1954 featuring Connor backed by a drummerless trio comprised of Ellis Larkins on piano, Everett Barksdale on guitar and Beverly Peer on bass. The other two tracks by Connor were recorded in NYC on August 21, 1954 and feature Connor backed by Ronnie Odrich on flute and clarinet, Don Burns on accordion, Joe Cinderella on guitar, Vinnie Burke on bass and Art Mardigan on drums.\\n\\nI think the highlight is Nina Simone, but I also love Carmen Mcrae\\'s tracks. In fact I love all three. this is more of a compilation of Bethlehem\\'s top female vocal talent in the 1950s, although it was released after Nina had left the label on not so good terms.

I know there will be die-hard fans to disagree with me (\"it\\'s not that bad\") - they think everything this poetess does is gold - but c\\'mon, can you really agree that this electronic tinny percussion-driven album is enjoyable to listen to?\\n\\nThe only thing worth exploring (and maybe allows some forgiveness for this mess of an album) are the 2 songs here (Every Breath, Love Somebody) that were done in her original singer-songwriter style on the previously recorded LP Seventh Wave, and the original version of Apathy (the b-side to the one-off 1981 Epic single \"One More Try\").

This does not mean that it is bad per say but it simply does not measure up to previous albums.  The Worldless Orchestra was great in the live setting, but here in the studio, the strings actually detract from the music.  Unlike most of their releases, there is no real fluctuation in mood.  On most albums there is an ebb and flow from pastoral beauty to massive aggression and back again, kind of like a prog rock Pixies.  For My Parents really has just one mood, soft & mellow minimalism.  And on the vinyl release was it really necessary for a double album?  Two sides are shorter than 10 minutes a piece.  I'll keep the album for completeness, but it is a very disapointing show from the generally fantastic Mono.\", 'summary': 'Mono-dimensional', 'unixReviewTime': 1348185600, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1407}\n",

McCreesh is an expert at recreation, and here he has amassed massive forces to recreate Mendelssohn\\'s oratorio as performed at an important 1846 Birmingham Festival.  Orchestra strings have been augmented as have woodwinds and brass, which here include wonderful serpent, an ophecleide, the even more rare bass ophecleide, period trombones and bass trombones, indeed the whole array of beautiful sweeping 19th century massive sound, a massive, yet expert and clear, powerful choir of 350 (no Mormon Tabernacle mush here), and as good an array of soloists as one could hope to find for this piece today, headed with the dramatic and forceful Elijah of Simon Kennlyside and a particularly radiant soprano solo from Rosemary Joshua.  The climaxes are a feast of sound, and the recording, extremely spacious, captures the grandiosity of the proceedings to perfection.  Yes there are smaller Elijahs with smaller forces, some like that by Robert Shaw with intermediate forces, but if one is going to go for Elijah, one might as well get it as it was served in its heyday, and how it enthralled the composer himself.  And Paul McCreesh\\'s is as good as it is likely to get.\\n\\nBut then, there is the work itself.  It contains isolated spots of very beautiful music, such as the little trio \"Lift Thine Eyes\" quickly followed by the gorgeous chorus \"He Watcheth Over Israel\", up there with the Hebrides Overture and some of the Songs Without Words and the piano trios as truly superlative in Mendelssohn\\'s canon.  Overall, Elijah is a bore. Imagine reading a book consisting of declarative sentences only and this is what Elijah sounds like.  It is Mendelssohn at his unimaginative worst. All the exotic period instruments dug up for this recording do not mask the dearth of orchestral color in this unfortunate score. Furthermore, the whole thing is cloaked in Victorian sanctimoniousness that makes one long for the tawdrier Italian operas of the period, full of poisons, sword-fights, and damsels in distress, not to mention colorful, energetic music by mostly second-rate composers.  But on a more serious vein, contemporaneously with this piece, Hector Berlioz was writing his Requiem, a true masterpiece, far more moving than this four-square exercise in Victorian self-serving piety. Berlioz\\'s was a piece looking to the future, for massive forces intelligently deployed and sparsely used, a truly great composition whereas Elijah is not even a  good one.  I plan no trips any time soon to Birmingham, or Liverpool, or Manchester, so maybe I will avoid stoning.  I don\\'t think I am the first to point out that this oratorio is a beached whale (maybe one on Jonah would have been livelier!).  I cannot honestly say that if somehow your music collection feels incomplete without an Elijah, this would be a fun one to have, because there is no way I can conceive of Elijah as being anything near \"fun.\" But should the hole in your shelf require filling, like mine I felt did because the other versions I had never redeemed the piece, this one will provide great sounds to show off your sound system, without still redeeming the piece. Otherwise, you\\'d be wise to explore other romantic choral music, like McCreesh\\'s own excellent performance of the Berlioz Requiem, or Britten\\'s performance of Schumann\\'s Scenes from Faust, etc. There\\'s also much better Mendelssohn than this.', 'summary': 'The Stars are for the Performance, the Work is another matter', 'unixReviewTime': 1349049600, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1464}\n",

As a Bruckner-lover, I found myself completely off-balance listening to this.  I'm not a jazz fan to start with (and that may be a great reason to ignore this review).  And while I'll give the performers credit for inventiveness, I guess at the end of the day my question is: to what end?  Will a Bruckner-lover want to hear Anton Bruckner's music and themes mangled and played in a genre and manner which would be completely foreign--and probably offensive to the man who wrote them or anyone who truly loves them?  Or will this appeal to jazz fans who have no exposure to Bruckner and may find something interesting in this?\\n\\nI doubt the latter, because while this performance preserves the notes of some of the themes, what it does not preserve is the spirit/essence of the music, which is what makes Bruckner's symphonies so moving and distinctive.  Will it bring Bruckner-lovers to jazz?  Well, in a meaningless sample of one, the answer is no.  Will it bring jazz-lovers to Bruckner?  I doubt it.\\n\\nThere's no question in my mind that these performers truly love Bruckner's music, or else they wouldn't have done what they did here.  But I'm not so sure that love of the music translates into doing riffs on it in a way that to my ears fundamentally mangles and distorts it.\", 'summary': 'What should one make of this?', 'unixReviewTime': 1418428800, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1502}\n",

Toscanini was actually a fine Gershwin conductor, perhaps not as fluent in the jazz idiom as some others but with a firm grasp of the composer's internal logic and structure.  I doubt you will find a better or more coherent performance of American in Paris, and in all of these pieces the conductor's attention to detail and meticulous phrasing and dynamics serve the music well.  And even Toscanini's legendary swift tempi are a match to the composer's own performances.  Earl Wilde is his usual magnetic self in the Rhapsody, and Oscar Levant gives a highly-charged and (to me) convincing reading of the Concerto.\\n\\nSo why two stars?  Because these transfers are pretty bad.  They appear to have been made from old LPs, with little or no filtering or adjustment for dynamics or pitch (or even editing for glitches in the source material).  The result is strident strings, obvious surface noise, dynamic overload in loud passages and, in several cases, skips in the music (like what you'd get if you had a scratch or a small particle stuck to the grooves of an LP).\\n\\nThere are better transfers of the Rhapsody and Concerto and I encourage you to buy those instead.  As for American in Paris, this is the only CD copy of the live 1943 performance I know of that's currently available.  Toscanini did record the piece again in the studio in 1945 and that recording is still available on an RCA CD.  Like most Toscanini studio performances I've been able to compare to live ones, the studio version is a bit stiff, but the performances are essentially the same, the sound is better, and it remains my favorite.\\n\\nGo elsewhere.\", 'summary': 'Buy these splendid performances in decent transfers, not this garbage', 'unixReviewTime': 1501718400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1551}\n",

It contends that just because a performance exhibits a feeble one-card-trick (say, no vibrato) to the exclusion of everything else (musicality, thought, innerness) does not mean that it\\'s necessarily associated with Sir Roger Norrington. Thoman Fey, in his dreadful Haydn series, supports this contention. Jeggy too, advocate of brisk efficiency, comes into frame. By all means, give unto Roger what belongs to Roger (Rule 303 comes to mind at this point - metaphorically speaking), but he shouldn\\'t monopolise the parameters of incompetence.\\n\\nThat\\'s the theory. Here\\'s Norrington in practice. I\\'d like to say that it\\'s a forgettable affair but sadly that\\'s not the case. Nor does he take a single trick. I\\'ve yet to hear a more brainless performance of the slow movement of the Clock - since when does Andante equate to Prestissimo? Infinitesimal delays - a denoter of mastery - are absent per se. With the elimination of vibrato, swarms of bees, accompanied by the odd mouse or two, come to mind at innumerable points. There\\'s little or no \"ascent\" in these readings: time-beating and repetition are all. At 19\\'24\", it\\'s death-by-repeats in the first movement of the Prague - to no vivid end.  The student-orchestra in question is what it is and the conductor fails to elicit anything more from it. It makes heavy weather of the contrapuntal development in K 503 / 1.\\n\\n\"Reductio ad Rogerum\" is an obstruction to clear thinking. Norrington himself, baton in hand, is obfuscation. Fine though it be, heed the distinction!', 'summary': 'Playing the Norrington Card', 'unixReviewTime': 1438214400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1623}\n",

Oh puh-leeze!!! A whole album of improvised ukelele music? Good thing I was feeling adventurous or I would have missed out on a truly unique musical experience. Guitar virtuoso Andre Feriante met master craftsman David Poplar at one of Feriantes Seattle-area guitar concerts and the two collaborated on making five different versions of the ukelele. One is a six-string model with a ukelele body and a guitar neck; there is a five-string version; a tenor four-string; a three-string ukelele that looks and sounds like an ancient Celtic instrument; and a traditional concert model. Trained as a classical guitarist from a very young age (including a stint with the legendary Andres Segovia), there is a much stronger Latin/Spanish influence in these ten improvisations (all recorded in a single night) than the Hawaiian stylings usually associated with the ukelele. The liner notes indicate which instrument was used as well as descriptions of each song. An experiment in musical storytelling, Novella is a one-of-a kind listening experience that incorporates Celtic, Spanish, Italian, Hawaiian and American blues influences that reflect Feriantes world travels and eclectic artistry.\\n\\n\"Novella\" begins with Rio By Night, which expresses the restful calm of the beach at the end of an adventure. Peaceful and very relaxed, its a beautiful beginning. Of Wing and Wing goes to Hawaii where exotic birds are dancing over the water. This magical piece conveys bright, sparkling water as well as the freedom of the colorful birds. Arabesque is a dark and haunting Moorish serenade played on the six-string ukelele (which sounds  more like a fine classical guitar). La Portuguesa speaks to the ukes Spanish Old World roots, and Feriantes four-string ukelele also sounds very much like a full-sized classical guitar. Blues on the ukelele? Yep! Sweet Nadine delivers with the most American-sounding song on the album. Othellos Dream is a light and gentle musical depiction of England during Shakespearean times. Eyes In the Forest is a dark minor-key exploration, much of which is played in the bass of the six-string ukelele. Free-form and haunting, it brings this fascinating album to a close.\\n\\nPut aside your thoughts of what a traditional ukelele sounds like and prepare to be mesmerized by Andre Feriantes new take on this instrument.

In fact a great organist like Hal Shutz can even make a little Hammond Chord organ sound amazing. Every mood, and I mean every mood, can be portrayed through the organ. This is why if someone says they hate organ music it means they are one of two things- impatient or tone deaf. These days people are more impatient than ever. I recommend everyone take just two weeks spending just 1 hour each of those days and pick out a selection of organ music. I guarantee that after those two weeks you will be a big fan of Jesse Crawford, or Walter Wanderley, or George Wright, or Ann Leaf, or Eddie Layton, or Klaus Wunderlich, or Reginald Dixon, or Horace Finch, or Lenny Dee, or Jimmy Smith, or Ethel Smith, or John Winters , or Paul Mickelson, or Don Baker, or Bob Ralston...and the list goes on and on.\\nThe great electronic organ from 1935 the early 70's are the best models to seek out for a second hand model ( much better than digital). The Hammond Chord organ model S-6 that you hear on this Hal Shutz record is smaller and easy to manage in any home or apartment, at 140 pounds. I can assure you though that the 3rd song on the record is not a Chord organ unless he did a few overdubs or multiple tracks and mixed together, but you never know with a remarkable musician like Hal Shutz, it just might be the Chord organ at that.\", 'summary': 'Greatest unrecorded artist, but they did have tape recorders, eh?', 'unixReviewTime': 1388966400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1811}\n",

But just like its original, Skylanders-Giants has a score that actually stimulates your adventures to a magical toe-tapping orchestral rhythm.\\n\\nScottish composer and Grammy Award winning Lorne Balfe who has composed the background scores for such games as Rango, Crysis 2, Assassins Creed Revelations and the original Skylanders- Spyro's Adventures has achieved an even more energetic and `feel-good' score for Skylander- Giants. His other credits include producing such scores as Sherlock Holmes and Inception.\\n\\nYour mission is to find treasures, special hats and defeat the all-evil KAOS in dozens of lands. As each section of the adventure unfolds the orchestral accompaniment of Balfe's score sends you running, battling or into very mysterious areas and you are cautiously searching your way through each colorful adventure. Lorne Balfe does an amazing job at bringing fun, fancy and magicality into an extremely melodi yet vibrant soundtrack.\\n\\nTrack by track: From the opening cue called `Giants' that swings with passion and power and the rush of a grand adventure of fun and magic. `Junkyard Isles' has the fanciful rhythms and beats that make you want to dance with almost a Keltic swing. `Rumbletown' has the sweet sting of a marching and mysterious rhythm that makes the mind think, `look before you leap!'\\n\\nNow, `Cutthroat Carnival' has the fancy fair of a darker and yet perkier tone that will make you swing in rhythm to the beat. I enjoy the string arrangements on this one and the underscoring of the brass and tympani. `Glacier Gully' has an almost ethereal quality to it and it again uses the beauty of the string to convey it wonderment and yes majesty of its passion.\\n\\nDanger seems to be eminent in the cue `The Secret Vault of Secrets'. It moves fast and deep with an accompaniment that makes you want to rush through your adventure. That wisp of magic still in the air. `The Oracle' is exactly what it says. It is short but amazing. `Wilkin Village' has a friendly family feel to its rhythm and I can imagine playing the game and being surprised once again by the colors and characters I see and I can imagine this in my head just listening to this grand piece of music.\\n\\n`Ariel Attack'. Is a proud piece of music that is rhythmic and foreboding with a hint of humor and amazing play of melodies. `Drill X's Big Rig' is more electronic and whipping in nature and obviously gives the emotion of size and danger. `Molkin Mountain' is another forceful and proud cue that has the same proud rhythms as before but in more brash and bold tones. `Arena Battle' is exactly that a march and collection of battle-sounding drums and percussion that leave you to believe the battle is here and you are right in the middle of it.\\n\\nClosing out the soundtrack are the cues `Auto Gyro Adventure' which starts slow and then again takes its strings and percussion to a level that implies magic, wonder and amazement. `Slippery Tunnel' is soft and subtle at first and then rhythms of percussion swiftly glide you to an incredible melody of music that makes this my second favorite cue of the score. I found myself humming this one even after I stopped listening to it.\\n\\nLastly the cut `Bringing Order To Kaos' closed the soundtrack with a low toned base filled choral sounding chant that slowly builds and climbs in rhythm. Then its done. It's all over. The end. Bummer.\\n\\nI really loved this score and each cut, for me was way too short. For soundtrack collectors and fans of Lorne, this is a must to have. Yes, I have played Skylanders and I remember when first playing it I said aloud, this score would be great soundtrack to have. It's here. It's bold and fun and very magical in its emotion and deserves to be listened all on its own.\", 'summary': 'Skylander-Giants Has A Fantastical Adventure Musical Motif!', 'unixReviewTime': 1349654400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1835}\n",

As such, THE LORD OF STEEL came out thirty years after their first release. Whiners love to complain about the supposedly bad bass-heavy production, but in my opinion this is the best Manowar album since 1992\\'s THE TRIUMPH OF STEEL and arguably their first four albums from 1982-1984. In fact, it reminds me of that early era and is comparable.\\n\\nWhile FIGHTING THE WOLRD (1987), KINGS OF METAL (1988) and THE TRIUMPH OF STEEL were decent and had their high points, LOUDER THAN HELL (1996) increased the cheese factor with the additions of orchestrations. Manowar upped the ante toward sappy symphonic epics in the 2000s with WARRIORS OF THE WORLD (2002) and GODS OF WAR (2007).\\n\\nWith THE LORD OF STEEL they rightly strip everything down for an actual metal album, which has several highlights: The excellent ballad Righteous Glory, which has hints of Queensryches The Lady Wore Black, the Eagles Hotel California and Bathorys  Song to Hall Up High. Then theres the great unconventional doom of Black List (unconventional in a structural sense) immediately followed by the catchy and heavy Expendable, which was probably inspired by The Expendables movie franchise and shouldve been used for the soundtrack of one of those films. The last song, The Kingdom of Steel, is also a highlight and epic. All the rest of the songs are listenable with Touch the Sky and El Gringo standing out, the latter seemingly an homage to Ennio Morricones scores to spaghetti Westerns. Manowarriors is a catchy anthem to Manowar fans and the speedy title track is a decent choice to open the album. Heck, even \"Annihilation\" and \"Hail, Kill and Die\" are memorable. \"Born in a Grave\" is also quite good despite some insipid lyrics. In case you didn\\'t notice, I just named every song on the album, which explains my high rating.\\n\\nSpeaking of the lyrics, they\\'re generally one-dimensional and cheesy in the manner of a lot of Manowar lyrics, but they\\'re true to the bands comic booky Warrior Metal/Viking Metal theme. What else is new? These guys are professionals and they well know their lyrics are equal parts over-the-top, fun and comical. Listen, for instance, to \"Pleasure Slave\" and try NOT busting out laughing. Anyone who takes such lyrics seriously needs to visit the psyche ward. That said, they DO have some songs with interesting and evocative lyrics, like \"Guyana (Cult of the Damned),\" \"Achilles, Agony and Ecstasy in Eight Parts\" and \"Spirit Horse of the Cherokee.\" Let\\'s give credit where credit\\'s due.  As for the production, I don\\'t see the problem. The bass is prominent, but thats nothing new with bassist Joey DeMaio as the bandleader. This is just an all-around enjoyable modern release from Manowar. I\\'m glad they moved away from the dull, maudlin orchestrational crapola.\\n\\nGRADE: A-', 'summary': \"The best Manowar album since 1992's THE TRIUMPH OF STEEL\", 'unixReviewTime': 1452643200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 1869}\n",

I agree with some other reviews I have read that the Nielsen Symphonies are underplayed and undervalued, especially in the mid-twentieth century genre. This is probably true of all Nielsen, in my opinion, although the Symphonies are among his most respected works. This pairing of the second and third is a very interesting and rewarding disc of two quite unusual works. Both works sound and \"feel\" programmatic but Nielsen always steadfastly denied that. The closest example of the perception of \"programmatic\" is \"The Four Temperments\", referring at least in origin, to the theories of the human psyche by the Greek physician Galen. Similarly, Nielsen intended his \"Espansiva\" to represent - somewhat - the various moods and sounds one experiences in nature; though never too literally. The performances, here, are just a little understated and less volatile than some renditions although they are very fine. I personally think this whole series of the Nielsen Symphony with the New York Phil and Alan Gilbert is one of the best available. The performances are quite good and the SACD sound from DaCapo is excellent. I also think that, perhaps, this set will stand as one of the best things Gilbert did with New York is his relatively short tenure.

That such a solid release has emerged, one that must rank among their best work, is a tribute to Zachs persistence and the synergy he has with the new members.\\n\\nAs Zach affirms in a couple of the songs, losing our way does not make us a lost cause. Crisis serves as a setting for the brokenness and hope that inform the lyrics.\\n\\nOn different note, if Coldplay helped bring the piano back to rock, Remedy Drive benefits from that legacy. The creative use of keyboards woven into the fabric of many of these songs is striking. They are the first sounds that you hear on the opening, Better than Life. They continually add a subtle and satisfying beauty to the well-crafted pop/rock found throughout.\\n\\nI enjoy the latter and normally don't gravitate towards heavier fare. Even so, the hard rock heard on the title track and Make it Bright are strangely beguiling. The raw energy makes these tracks explosive and compelling.\\n\\nBut have you heard the story of Elijah, the Old Testament prophet? God was not in the strong wind, the earthquake or the fire, but in the sound of a low whisper, a thin silence, which brings me to God I Hope So. It is not the sound of quiet desperation, but rather a hopeful longing. Its an honest cry that yearns for a better day. It carries even greater weight than the heavier sounds in the aforementioned tracks. I appreciate the uncertainty because thats what life is like. We can be certain of God but not much else.\\n\\nRemedy Drive move toward modern worship on Crystal Sea and Glory. If the band was ever dead, this is life from the dead. They add their voice to that mighty throng that stands by the crystal sea.\\n\\nThe theme of the closing Hold On reminds me of the words from Rock of Ages, Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling.

So I've been listening to their music at one point or another for more than 15 years now. Except for 'Here Comes the Zoo', I own all of their major LPs. And while I can't claim that Local H is my absolute favorite band, they are one of the few decisively non-metal bands that I still pay a reasonable amount of attention to.\\n\\nREVIEW: The album is, in a word, disappointing. To echo the words of another reviewer, calling this a double LP is VERY generous at best and patently false otherwise. If I had to compare this to a previous Local H LP, it would be 'Pack Up the Cats'...the same sort of under-produced sound quality, a lot of useless throw-away tracks, and very few tracks that I would call 'catchy' (i.e. you listen to it once and you immediately like it). At least 'Pack Up...' had very few mediocre-ish tracks on it, however.\\n\\n1.)Waves - Useless throw-away track that's basically part 1 of the first actual song on the album.\\n2.)Cold Manor - Part 2 of the first song. Ok/mediocre/largely forgettable. (4.5/10)\\n\\n3.)Night Flight to Paris - Best track on the album. Catchy. (8.5/10)\\n\\n4.)They Saved Reagan's Brain - Fairly bad, though a few parts are what I'd call interesting. Listenable I guess. (3.5/10)\\n\\n5.)Blue Line - Ok. (5.5/10)\\n\\n6.)Another February - This seemed to be a favorite of other reviewers, but I personally didn't think this was all that special. Ok/mediocre. (5/10)\\n\\n7.)Say the Word - The other good track on the album. Unfortunately, the better part of the song doesn't come until 2 minutes in. (7.5/10)\\n\\n8.)Cold and Mannered - Useless throw-away track.\\n\\n9.)Trash Fire Bummers - Another throw-away. Why this wasn't made into a serious song, I have no idea, because it reasonably could have been.\\n\\n10.)Feed a Fever - Ok/mediocre. (4.5/10)\\n\\n11.)Here Come Good Ol' Laptop - What I'd call an interesting track and better than average, but not quite 'good'. (6.5/10)\\n\\n12.)Look Who's Walking... - The country song, and not a terribly good one either. What is this doing on a Local H album? It simply doesn't belong and it was a bad decision by Lucas to include it. Easily the worst track on the album and nearly un-listenable (I admit country isn't my favorite genre, but I don't hate it either).(3/10)\\n\\n13.)Ruling Kind - Ok/decent. (6/10)\\n\\n14.)Limit Your Change - Ok/Decent. Unfortunately, it's only about 2 minutes long, so it's kind of another throw-away. (6.5/10)\\n\\n15.)Paddy Considine - The most amusing track on the album. Actual song length is only about 3:20, however. (6/10)\\n\\n16.)Sad History - Sort of ballad-ish. Ok/mediocre. (4.5/10)\\n\\n17.)Waves Again - Slowish, but not quite a ballad. Ok/mediocre. (4.5/10)\\n\\nCONCLUSION: Some reviewers have said that many of the tracks on here would have been better suited to Scott Lucas' other band, 'Scott Lucas and the Married Men'. While I can't say for sure (I wasn't impressed by '...Married Men' upon some brief listens), I suspect those reviewers might be on to something. It seems likely that Lucas did indeed cross-pollinate '...Married Men' ideas into this album.\\nAlso, for an album that was promoted as being political, it seems to be far less about politics than one might expect. Even the lyrics that ARE political aren't particularly deep or interesting. I still don't understand what Lucas' overall political message even IS.\\n\\nBottom line: this is easily Local H's worst LP to date.\", 'summary': 'Not Terribly Great', 'unixReviewTime': 1357603200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2306}\n",

Musically they are devoid of any inspiration outside of their lame channeling of Gabriel era Genesis, but without any of the memorable melodies of yore. Much instrumental noodling but little else. In fact, I find it impossible to commit any of their meandering compositions to memory, so insipid are their attempts at writing a good tune. Predictable chordings rapidly become irritating, rendering the tracks effectively indistinguishable from one other. And lyrically - I\\'m not sure what to say. The constant repetition of banal lines with ever increasing accompaniment, as if the very process of doing this could somehow magically transform dross into something profound and meaningful. A typical example (from the tweely entitled Winchester from St Giles Hill):\\n\"A river flowing from the chalk hills\\nthrough the water meadows and the open fields.\\nWalls were made and streets were laid down,\\nhalls and houses, schools and churches\"\\nYikes! To commit this atrocity to paper is bad enough, but then to put it to melody (or what passes in the BBT world as melody) just adds insult to injury.

Here is a listing of the tracks (in the order they appear in on the comp):\\n\\nHelp Me Rhonda (the album version from Beach Boys Today!, not the single version, which I think is better)\\nDance, Dance, Dance\\nWhen I Grow Up (To Be A Man)\\nJohnny B. Goode (live track from Beach Boys Concert album)\\nFun, Fun, Fun (stereo album version from Shut Down Vol. 2)\\nKeep An Eye On Summer\\n409\\nPet Sounds (a good track, but seems kind of out-of-place in this collection)\\nLittle Deuce Coupe\\nDo You Wanna Dance\\nSloop John B.\\nShut Down\\nSurfin\\' U.S.A.\\nThe Little Old Lady From Pasadena (from Beach Boys Concert; the best live track here)\\nThe Wanderer (from Beach Boys Concert)\\nSurfin\\'\\n\\nHowever, this collection still isn\\'t as good overall as many of the bigger comps that have been released (including the abovementioned double-set ones); hence my low rating.', 'summary': 'another double-set Beach Boys best-of', 'unixReviewTime': 1376870400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2363}\n",

It is a traditional opera buffo, with a pre-set libretto which Mozart could not adapt. The libretto is long on farce and short on human sympathy or empathy. Mozart was undoubtedly hindered by having only a reputedly limited and lack-lustre orchestra available. La Finta Giardiniera is nevertheless a remarkable work, Mozart using music to overcome many of the libretto's shortcomings and presenting ideas that later -- especially in the Marriage of Figaro -- the composer would rocket into the operatic firmament. Nevertheless, the opera bombed at its initial production and lived on mainly as a Singspiel in German translation.\\n\\nJacobs' recording features a version with much fuller orchestral arrangement than the original, produced in Prague late in the 18th century. Who made the arrangement and why is unknown, but it matches Mozart's later style very well and certainly enriches the opera. Jacobs produces a hard-driven version using young, highly talented and engaged performers with a first class orchestra and chorus. This makes for an exciting and highly enjoyable set. The concentration is on the drama more than on the lovely music. This is particularly evident in the recitatives secco where if anything overacting is evident. These are accompanied by a forte piano on steroids. Initially, this is amusing, soon it becomes irritating, and ends by being infuriating.\\n\\nI suppose the main cd  rival to this set must be the version featuring Harnoncourt. This set of course uses the original orchestration -- or so one presumes. It is weaker for that reason, but not seriously so. Harnoncourt of course uses his Concentus Musicus Wien, and I think that Jacobs Freiburger Barockorchester produces a much more pleasing sound. Jacobs is recorded with a brighter sound than Harnoncourt. Both conductors have their quirks, but over all I prefer Harnoncourt whose slightly more relaxed approach allows for the beauty of the music to shine through better. Harnoncourt has a more distinguished cast, and on balance this counts strongly for him, but Jacobs' singers are more exciting. Harnoncourt's recitatives are much more attractive than Jacobs' and that swings the balance to him in my opinion. However, I would not be without either set. I expect to keep listening to both -- but more frequently to Harnoncourt than to Jacobs.\", 'summary': 'Revealing Interpretation', 'unixReviewTime': 1388880000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2447}\n",

He is believed to have said, \"Meine Prager verstehen mich\" - my Praguers understand me.  Eight Mozart operas enjoyed fame in Prague, most of which are familiar to listeners today:  Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail, Idomeneo, Der Schauspieldirektor, Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, Cosi fan Tutte, La Clemenza di Tito, Die Zauberflte, and the present La finta giardiniera.  The publishers in Prague are largely responsible for the dissemination of Mozart\\'s operas to the rest of Europe, helping to cement Mozart\\'s name as an opera composer for posterity.  Of these operas, Der Schauspieldirektor and La finta giardiniera are the only ones which have not become part of the standard repertoire.  This is unfortunate, as La finta giardiniera is a stellar example of the transition of a child prodigy into a mature composer.\\n\\nLa finta giardiniera has perhaps the most troubled history of any Mozart opera.  The 18-year-old Mozart wrote it for performances in Munich.  He and his father wrote home to their family in Salzburg that the opera had been a success, but in reality it had been \"hissed\" and received only a few performance, at least one of which was drastically shortened.  In 1779, Mozart had the libretto translated from Italian to German, cut the recitatives, and performed it as a Singspiel, Die vestellte Grtnerin.  The Italian version, subsequently, went lost until its rediscovery in the mid 20th century.  However, a few years after Mozart\\'s death in 1791, a few versions of La finta giardiniera were floating around Prague, versions which expanded Mozart\\'s scant early orchestra to proportions more familiar to Mozart\\'s later operas.  Rene Jacobs has chosen to record the version dubbed the Namest edition of circa 1796-97.\\n\\nA word about the version Rene Jacobs has chosen.  If re-orchestrations of beloved works make you queasy for so perversely distracting the listener from the original composer\\'s intentions (e.g. Mozart\\'s arrangements of Hndel\\'s oratorios or Mendelssohn\\'s arrangements of Bach\\'s passions), such concerns are very much not present here.  Various scholars since the early 20th century have remarked on the quality and sensitivity that the heretofore anonymous arranger of the Namest edition \"touched up\" the youthful Mozart score.  At least one scholar suggested that the Namest edition originated from a version in Mozart\\'s own hand (more details are available in the liner notes).  Those familiar with the original will find the 18-year-old Mozart used a rather thin orchestra-common for Munich in the mid-1770s but rather dull compared to the character of Mozart\\'s later operas.  However, even though the Namest arranger added clarinets, flutes, trumpets and timpani to match the forces of Mozart\\'s mature works, he did so with such sensitivity to Mozart\\'s compositional style that he was undoubtedly a connoisseur of the late composer\\'s music, adding tasteful and skillful Mozartian counterpoint here and there.  We have here an arrangement of La finta giardiniera that is not distracting, but within the character of late Mozart.  It adds a new meaning to the above quote attributed to the late composer.\\n\\nAmong the changes implemented were substantial interweaving of woodwinds throughout (it adds clarinets, bassoons, flutes, trumpets, timpani.  The original relies mostly on bare strings supplemented by oboes), expansion of the viola section, and shortening of the lengthy instrumental introductions for several arias (an outmoded Baroque practice which Mozart\\'s almost completely eschewed in his mature operas because it detracted too much from the forward thrust of drama).  What we are left with is a La finta giardiniera as we would expect a mature Mozart to have written.  One is tempted to think this is what Mozart might have done with La finta giardiniera/Die verstellte Grtnerin had he revisited it in his later years (indeed, Mozart was no stranger to revising his own operas; he translated the present opera, rewrote chunks of Don Giovanni and Idomeneo, and intended another major rewrite of Idomeneo which never came to fruition).  The three finales here are especially striking, as they have been orchestrated to sound akin to the finales Mozart wrote for the famous Da Ponte operas: Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cosi.  Even in the original version, you can very much hear in the Act I and II finales Mozart\\'s attempts at complex, extended ensembles without recitatives-forshadowing the great Act II finale of Figaro.  The Namest arranger has brought Le finta giardiniera even closer to Figaro\\'s sound world.\\n\\nTurning now to the merits of the recording itself, Rene Jacobs has surprised us again.  This La finta giardiniera is not a set that is merely for the Mozart completist; rather it is delightfully listenable thanks to forward thrust of action (due in part to the Namest arranger, due in part to Rene Jacobs\\'s conducting and his soloists).  It is a recording that can easily stand next to Jacobs\\'s readings of Cosi fan Tutte and Le nozze di Figaro.  Finally-a recording of Mozart early opera buffa that shines next to the Da Ponte trilogy.  We have here cases of mistaken identity (Roberto/Nardo, Violante/Sandrina), handled with the same sensitivity as in the later operas (Susanna/Rosina, Giovanni/Leporello, Guglielmo/Tizio, Ferrando/Sempronio).  The composer of the Namest edition surely understood how Mozart achieved the emotional sweep in his later years.\\n\\nFreiburg Barockorchester plays with sparkling vigor under Jacobs as always.  From the opening timpani strikes in the Overture, you find yourself hooked to this early Mozart piece.  In the buffo \"mad scene\" in the Act II Finale, we see our two protagonists lose their minds, assuming the personalities out of a Graeco-Roman pastoral opera, as the orchestra comments; the oboes mimic bagpipes or chaumes, the basses and cellos mimic the drones of a musette, while the strings play pizzicato like Orpheus\\'s lyre.  A signature in Jacobs\\'s recordings is the prevalence of improvisation in the basso continuo.  Especially touching and noteworthy is the fortepiano\\'s quote of Mozart\\'s very late \"Adagio for Glass Harmonica, K617a,\" played as an introduction to the opening secco recitative of Act III.  (Written very close to Mozart\\' death, Jacobs\\'s employs it here as a beautifully eery, yet subtle nod to the composer in this reading of a posthumous version of what is perhaps his greatest childhood work.  It admittedly has no connection with La finta giardiniera, but it adds a profound touch.)\\n\\n\"Da scirocco a tramontana\" foreshadows the arias of Rossini.  Here Jeremy Ovenden shines as the Count Belfiore.  Here, the Count brags about his Roman ancestry-he purports to be a descendant of the Roman emperors and consuls.  He strikes a perfect balance with the enlarged orchestra which plays with bombast, both to augment and poke fun at the Count\\'s pretentiousness.  It is one of the highlights of the record and easily allows Ovenden to be the record\\'s star.\\n\\nThe baritone Nicolas Rivenq sings yet another one of the record\\'s highlights, \"Dentro il mio petto io sento.\"  The orchestra explodes toward the end of the aria to bring it to a bombastic close, an effect one would expect from Cosi fan Tutte.  I have been surprised to see Rivenq, a baritone, beginning to take on roles more commonly taken by tenors (the High Priest in Idomeneo, for example).  The warmer color of his voice is a nice touch to the older Don Anchise here, and his voice does sound completely at home in this upper range.\\n\\nWe also have the delightful soprano spinto, Sunhae Im, and a personal favorite, Alexandrina Pendatchanska who gives us a deep and fiery reading of Arminda along the likes of Elettra or Donna Elvira.\\n\\nLa finta giardiniera is a rather difficult opera to cast.  Called an opera buffa, it is more of an drama giocoso, like Don Giovanni, combining dramatic and comic elements in one.  However, the rest of the cast is comfortable and in-character.  Jacobs has said that he finds it important when in the studio, that his singers be able to act using only the voice.  His present recording is a fine example of this.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this: This is a stellar recording of a skillful posthumous edition (only five years after Mozart\\'s death) by someone who knew Mozart\\'s music so well that the edition sounds authentic.  Together with Jacobs\\'s conducting and his winning cast, this is a highly recommended recording.', 'summary': '\"My Praguers Understand Me\"', 'unixReviewTime': 1349740800, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2448}\n",

However part of the ultra lounge charm that started in the 90s was the CDs, the packaging. With the advent of Mp3 digital, we loose all of the important historical liner notes and information.  Also with the first two volumes of Christmas Cocktails being outstanding...  by this Cocktail 4 we have lost a lot of steam.\\n\\nThis edition has mediocre selections that are not passed properly. It feels like a mix match of oddities instead of a flowing perfect  blend of styles..  In other words this cocktail leaves a nasty after taste.\\n\\nMy belief is they should have stopped after volume 2, and concentrated on expanding on the themes that worked like there first volume 1 Mondo Exotica\\n\\nOr a better idea would have been to compile all the cool jazz mellow xmas cuts on one cd and all the swingy hot xmas on another and still all the latin cuts on a 3rd.  It would have created better programming and flow. That was my beef with this album, to hear a mellow cut followed by something uptempo blasting in my ears.

Unfortunately, I didn\\'t know anything about this extremely talented artist until few weeks ago when Kev of Stormloop pointed rM community to this project. Big shame on me for not locating 36 much earlier, however, it\\'s always better later than never!!! Anyway, it\\'s time to unwrap this beauty. Visual part of \"Lithea\" strikes right away, a very nice matte-laminated 4-panel folded cardboard sleeve case with spine. Funny accented navigation communication between pilot and tower control perfectly introduces the name of the project. Warmly inviting drone with beautifully disturbing hiss on \"Cocoon\" is absolutely breathtaking, what a prelude!!! Spiralingly euphoric sonic bliss at its most evocative!!! I should mention the album is comprised of no less than 18 tracks, but some of them are rather shorter, transitional passages connecting longer movements. More minimal, frosty with hints of nostalgia \"Susurrus\" belongs to the longest pieces on this journey. The title track, \"Lithea\" hits with its melodramatic intensity, it\\'s a pity it clocks to 2 and half minutes only. Nostalgic warmness is gracefully floating through rainy \"Deluge\" with heavenly touch of distant choirs, organic and angelic stunner!!! Glitchy, but restful \"Radio\" nicely bridges \"Deluge\" with the next masterpiece, \"Reunion\". Filled with warmhearted feelings and again enriched by ethereal femme choirs. Gorgeously absorbing!!! Shorter, slightly more experimental \"1983\" with children\\'s voices brings back long forgotten memories from a childhood. \"One\" attracts with its deeply imaginative and relaxing dronescape while the following short, \"World After April\" invades with mysterious voice samples. Both, mechanically clocking \"Seance\" and warmly tinkling and drifting \"Dreamscape\" evoke a very intense and intimate moments. \"Dayasan\" keeps its enchanting quality while colored by hissy atmospheres and distant voices. Bridging \"Broken Toy\" is by far the most experimental piece here. Now it\\'s the time to enter the darker terrains with \"Leviathan\" and \"Levitate\". Deeply mysterious femme voices on \"Levitate\" soar over the deep dronescapes and reach the shores of purely visualizing sonic paradise!!! Glitchy drone ambience of \"Saphron\" follows the footsteps of \"Levitate\" with choirs of angelic beauty. Nearly 11 minutes long epilogue \"Another World\" is the next peak of \"Lithea\" with its slowly evolving, intense and evocative euphoria, peppered with factory-like clocking sounds. A truly grandiose finale!!! \"Lithea\" is loaded with magical beauty and emotional richness, and it captures the true essence of nostalgia, intimacy and warmness in each of the 18 tracks!!! An ultimate masterwork deserving my highest recommendation!!! Bravissimo, Dennis!!!\\n\\nRichard Grtler (Apr 07, 2012, Bratislava, Slovakia)', 'summary': '\"Lithea\" is loaded with magical beauty and emotional richness!!!', 'unixReviewTime': 1409443200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2532}\n",

I was impressed with several of their achievements and I especially wanted to know the outcome of Elizabeth Chan\\'s Christmas song dream. I was gravely disappointed.\\nElizabeth has a very average sounding voice. At first it\\'s sweet and pleasant but it quickly becomes boring and repetitive as the album plays out.\\nA lot of the songs sound the same because Elizabeth sings the same kind of notes in each one.\\nHowever, my major problem with the EP is the lyrics. The song used for her music video (which, by the way, is very tacky and \"fake happy\")repeatedly uses verses and lines from other famous Christmas songs. Chan claims to have penned this song, but she obviously borrowed lyrics from other songs which makes this song very unoriginal. The other tracks are original, but they are very dull and kind of hollow. Great music artists have a way of putting intense emotion and passion into their songs. It\\'s as if you can feel the feelings they felt as they sang the song. You can feel the passion they have for their art in their music. With Chan I feel none of this. The songs feel empty and rushed. I don\\'t feel the emotion in any of the songs.\\nThis is probably because Chan has admitted to writing over 200 Christmas songs. There is no way an someone can put their complete effort and passion into so many songs. It should take years to write so many songs, and yet Chan keeps cranking them out.\\nOverall, I think Chan needs to focus on the quality of her music over the quantity of songs and the fame. She has the potential to be great, but she has a lot of work to do. Her lyric content needs serious work, and her voice just doesn\\'t stand out as it is.\\nThis EP isn\\'t worth $5. I\\'d say each song is worth one listen to.

Doesnt seem like a very promising idea. Well actually it's quite enjoyable. If you like larry you probably play guitar. Well this is like getting a rare chance to hear him practice in his home studio, along with a computer click track or percussion program like you probably do too while practicing.  The percussion sounds just become a time keeping drone, which actually allows you to focus more on his guitar playing. If he had hired a real percussionist like Paulinho DaCosta on his old albums, it would compete more with the guitar, not to mention be far more costly in this day and age of do it yourself music with no label support. So taken for what this is, it's nice if you just want an inimate listen and hear new takes on his old tunes. Good both as background music, and to focus more deeply on his jazz chord changes and solos. The only flaw I hear is actual overload clipping distortion on transient peaks when he picks hard on some songs. Seems he set the recording preamp input gain level too high, or some other level in the recording software, as there is clipping thru out many of the songs on hard picking. Back to the music: He also reharmonizes a few of the tunes chords, which bring new life and extra flavors to these familiar classics, which makes them more interesting in this sparse setting. Doesnt sound too smooth jazzy either, which is nice. So again taken for what it is, it's a pleasant listen, and a rare chance to hear another side of him, in an extra intimate way. Kind of an odd concept, but with the state of music these days what can you expect from a studio type player in the days of few real studios and labels left that would pay a studio guitarist to come in. Gotta do things yourself these days.\", 'summary': 'intimate, like you are with him hearing him practice at home', 'unixReviewTime': 1356998400, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2778}\n",

Kilian\\'s also known for other scores such as Tsotsi, Rendition, and Before the Rains. I embarrassingly have to admit, however, that prior to hearing his score for Bless Me, Ultima, I hadn\\'t actually heard any of Mark Kilian\\'s work, but can say with absolute confidence that I\\'ll soon remedy that. Bless Me, Ultima therefore totally came out of left field, not only because of it being my introduction to Kilian, but because it\\'s such a deep and emotional journey with incredible and lush instrumentation.\\n\\nI\\'ll be honest in saying something else here; normally, the music that\\'s found on Bless Me, Ultima isn\\'t my cup of tea. But, part of the delight in listening to a musical score is the ability to lose oneself in the emotional backdrop of the respective composer as well as their and the filmmakers\\' intention for where that score takes you. I have no doubt that painstaking effort was invested by Mark Kilian when he composed this score, and one only has to hear the vast assembly of sound to be assured of this notion. The Bless Me, Ultima film, set in New Mexico in the 1940s, weaves a tale of a young boy and a folk healer, and given its origins incorporates a huge assortment of ethnic and tribal instruments. Most prominent in this regard are flamenco-style vocals and Native American flutes (which according to Lakeshore Records, Mark Kilian played himself), but also prevalent are acoustic guitars and slight orchestral elements, the last of which are sometimes used so slightly and buried that Bless Me, Ultima rarely seems to bear the semblance to a film score at all. Right from the start, the flamenco vocals and Native American pipes construct a mighty, touching, and ethnic-tinged theme song that\\'s repeated several times throughout the score, and the listener is greeted with music like that of a legendary journey through majesty, wonder, and stark, bountiful folklore from a far-off land. The first handful of tracks seem to create the skeleton for Kilian\\'s vision, each playfully indulging in only the slightest acoustic melodies while softly colliding with string arrangements like wispy, delicate clouds coalescing and swirling into one.\\n\\nThe middle few tracks are where Kilian\\'s compositions really start to explore each other, seeping into one another and drenching the listener\\'s ears with slack-jawed beauty and harmonic mysticism. \"Antonio\\'s Disappointment\" starts out mimicking Mark Knopfler\\'s romantic, acoustic passages from Princess Bride before chilling, melancholic strings begin to swell and overwhelm the listener a few tracks later on personal favorite \"Ultima\\'s Owl,\" recalling the most soothing and provocative work of James Horner. Over the course of the score, what I initially thought the most curious and inquisitive instrument, the Native American flute, became seamlessly interwoven to the awe-inspiring build of all later tracks, culminating with the flamenco vocals, scant percussion, and quaking bass horns of the score\\'s most prolific song, \"Confessions.\"\\n\\nAt some points, I can\\'t really tell if Kilian\\'s score for Bless Me, Ultima is trying to be more of a film score or a new intermingled world music album, but therein lies its sheer genius and absolutely stupefying ability to make the listener believe it was constructed by both serendipity and careful, diligent brilliance in parallel. Mark Kilian\\'s Bless Me, Ultima is incredible in the difference of its approach, in its beautiful causality, and in its wonderful, benevolent structure. Extremely highly recommended in every way, Bless Me, Ultima conjures a world of endless inspiration that will turn and perpetually hold the ear of any discerning musical listener.', 'summary': 'Bless Me, Ultima', 'unixReviewTime': 1350432000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2855}\n",

Wisner, ex of The Intervals and The Tints. The latter featured Flea\\'s daughter Clara Balzary on drums, a link that resulted in John Frusciante producing one of their records, and in 2005 they were invited to play the Vincent Callo curated All Tomorrow\\'s Parties Festival. Then they split. If my sums are right, Wisner was 17 years old.\\n\\nWhat followed for Wisner was a new company, various music projects for films, solo records and earlier this year a new album, \"For No One\", recorded with band mate Adam Cude, and completely funded by fans via Kickstarter, in just ten days. Now, six months later, a new EP. Cut from much the same cloth as its predecessor, \"Silent War\" continues the duo\\'s journey into spacey folktronica, where Cude\\'s wispy acoustic guitar plays gently with Wisner\\'s keyboards, and voice. It\\'s a lush, delicate combination, with a succession of musical peaks and ethereal tones.\\n\\nOn \"Obvious\" they\\'re at their most experimental. A young girl\\'s voice speaks half heard sentences about death and loss over drones and simple keyboard runs, and is intermittently interrupted by Wisner\\'s soaring vocals. Older listeners may shed a tear for their old Cocteau Twins albums. \"Sinking Boat\" is altogether more finely structured, and its otherworldly delivery does little to disguise a perfectly executed pop song. The title track is just as finely balanced and its equal.

Of course, back in the old, pre-digital days, it would have been a double-album set, and however big a fan we were, we would have rarely listened to \"Blonde On Blonde\", \"Exile On Main Street\" or \"The White Album\" in one uninterrupted session. Instead we would have cherry-picked favourite sides, wearing out the grooves, and flipping the discs only occasionally. We don\\'t seem to listen to albums in the same way these days; it\\'s either odd tracks on playlists or the whole thing, though \"Six Foot Soul\" seems to work, whichever way it\\'s played.\\n\\nIn 2007 Worth formed the band NIAYH (an acronym for \"Now Is All You Have\"), who are often compared to Pink Floyd. Solo, there\\'s a distinct folk, soul and jazz edge to much of his material. I\\'ve not seen his name mentioned anywhere else, but Shuggie Otis came to mind as \"Six Foot Soul\" gradually revealed its charms, though there\\'s also an element of the American jam band tradition present throughout the collection.\\n\\nAs already stated, it\\'s a lot of music to be cogitated and digested in one go, but it\\'s hardly a chore. Worth\\'s got an easy voice to live with and his band play it funky and lively, or mellow and chilled with equal aplomb. Sampled voices and non-musical interludes agreeably break up the sequencing, emphasizing individual songs, of which there are ample highlights; \"Come Out Into the Light\" and \"Captain Finger\" are both particularly laudable, but taken as a whole, I can wholeheartedly recommend every last second.', 'summary': 'Leicester Bangs Review (2012):', 'unixReviewTime': 1351468800, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2902}\n",

There are plenty of excellent arrangements for solo trumpet of Bach compositions by Maurice Andre, Alison Balsom and others. They usually include arias from Cantatas or transcriptions of suites or sonatas for flute or strings. I was skeptical when I first saw this CD on Spotify and wondering what the Matthew Passion would sound like as a (mostly) trumpet and Organ piece.  I was even more skeptical in view of the numbers chosen here: arias, chorals and especially recitatives. This is a resounding success. Dorthe Zielke has a very rich sound both on the Flugel and the Bb. Her attacks and phrasing are stylistically coherent and in good taste, just a hint of vibrato in the arias.  I really like the way she leans into the notes. Her recitatives are nothing short of stunning. For instance, listen to #11 \"Und von der sechsten Stunde an;\" Recitatives are sometimes ungrateful to the voice, but in that instance she conveys the storm of emotions of the Evangelist and Jesus quite strongly.', 'summary': 'I bought that recording', 'unixReviewTime': 1371168000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 2951}\n",

Messina\\'s best-known work, his composition for the score of the immensely successful Juno, is renowned as creative, prolific, and remarkably representative of the film\\'s content considering its unique motifs. With Butter, Messina again presents a listening experience in stark contrast to most modern and traditional film scores, but while successful in that regard, Butter will challenge film score listeners with frustrating elements in parallel.\\n\\nButter\\'s first track sets the stage for the score\\'s energetic, Motown-inspired contents, and right from the start and regardless of one\\'s exposure to the film, will get your foot tapping and prompt a casual smile. Though the leadoff song is the only one that contains vocals, the primary remainder of the score retains the Motown and moonlighting musical elements of alternating drum percussion and clapping, organ- and piano-driven tunes, and careless fun, all of which easily lend themselves to feelings of childlike nostalgia and tongue-in-cheek humor (furthered by the songs\\' titles). Unfortunately, the prevalence of this overall sound with little variability is one of the score\\'s weaknesses, except on \"Smokin\\'\" when electric guitar riffs are incorporated or on \"Knife Sisters\" when electronic elements are introduced. On later tracks such as the effective \"867 Sticks of Butter,\" Messina gets a little more soulful and emotive and temporarily ceases the percussion, but too soon later the foundational musical elements return, almost totally abolishing any lasting impression upon the listener.\\n\\nAnd \"too soon\" is Butter\\'s Achilles\\' heel indeed; with the score totaling forty-five tracks and duration of forty minutes, even a listener with an incredibly short attention span will quickly grow frustrated by how often the music starts anew and slightly changes direction. At seemingly the exact point when one becomes aurally invested, the cycle begins again with another track, and I can\\'t help but think that if they were longer, or joined with organ-driven monochromatic leads at the very least, Butter\\'s songs would illustrate a much more effective stylistic energy. While I have no doubt that the music is more fitting and rewarding in the film, the structure doesn\\'t truly lend itself to a standalone score release. Consequently, Mateo Messina\\'s Butter has an interesting style, but lacks cohesion; it illustrates thoughtfulness, but not continuance; it exudes life, but doesn\\'t incite passion. Finally, and most importantly, while Butter has energy, it doesn\\'t have electricity, and for that reason, is solely recommended to fans of the Butter film itself, than to that of film score listeners and collectors.', 'summary': 'Butter', 'unixReviewTime': 1351728000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 3052}\n",

I didn't care too much for Pest's vocals in this one. Now, don't get me wrong, it's a good album in its own right, but not good enough for me to play it over and over again like the previous releases. When it was first announced that this album was coming out, I was excited and couldn't wait. I mean, the bassist, Frank Watkins from Obituary is what sparked my interest, but I didn't hear too much of any bass in this CD. All in all, this CD didn't show any hunger, any anger, any energy.

Jessie Ware, Janelle Monae, and Icona Pop lead the pack in revitalizing female pop and, in doing so, putting out some of the best pop music today.\\n\\nEnter Sky Ferreira.  The \"Ghost\" EP sounds like a girl who knew she wanted to be a singer but wasn\\'t sure into what niche she fit.  Whether or not her writing or singing skills set her apart seems to be irrelevant, just get the product out so the \"career\" can get kick-started.  Every song flirts with a different \"style\" of music, not actual genres, just generic radio simulations thereof.  \"Lost in My Bedroom\" and \"Red Lips\"  have pseudo-electro leanings, but sound like nothing that actual electro (not electronic) musicians would be inspired to put out.  \"Sad Dream\" is a travesty, a poorly written cross between alt-country and Nora Jones-ish adult contempo, with a chorus that sounds like it was scrawled across a notebook while she was bored in history class. The title track is the worst song on the album...it\\'s just boring.\\n\\n\"Everything is Embarassing\" is, however, a terrific song.  The simple kick throughout is hollow and deep, the minimalist piano works well with it, and though her voice never really \"pushes\" itself, the song works in it\\'s restraint.  So, 1/6 songs is not so bad...\\n\\nUltimately, however, Sky Ferreira fails because of her transparency.  The pre-fabrication of these tracks is hard to ignore.  When an \"artist\" (I hesitate to use that word, but I wouldn\\'t dare call her a legitimate singer) is so young and new with so little material, yet has large production music videos, it becomes obvious that there is backing that less fortunate (but much more talented) musicians can\\'t take advantage of.  This fact wouldn\\'t bother me if Sky didn\\'t come across as feigning authenticity.  This EP is a sampler, NOT a sampling of her various influences, it is a samplER to fish for what fans will want, and therefor, how to make the most cash once a full length arrives.\\n\\nIndie cred she (somehow) gets.  I think it comes less form her actual talents and more from her willingness to network and flirt with the right people.  It\\'s also very likely that she grew up with connections that gave her an edge.  In the end, save for \"Everything is Embarrassing\", this is poorly thought out music hoping for an image that will work. It comes from disingenuous motives and is likely to be rejected by anyone who looking for something unique and heartfelt.', 'summary': 'Pre-fab DIY...Maybe?', 'unixReviewTime': 1380067200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 3197}\n",

I can tell you that I feel lighter as if the pain and pressure of the previous day was washed away.  I feel like I am more positive overall and that there world is no longer out to get me.  I guess you can say I feel as if my soul was cleaned while I was sleeping so that sensation alone makes this track very valuable to me.\\n\\n~@~ My Thoughts About The Sleep Learning Series Sleep Sanctuary ~@~\\n\\nPersonal Note: I have been a fan and user of the Binaural Beat\\'s for a few years now until my Kindle suggested this one night when I was having sleep issues. WOW All I can say is that this stuff is the best out on the market to date! It works! Works so much that when I started using it I was waking up with horrid headaches. I soon learned that is a sign that my mind is over active during my sleep cycle so I had to adjust my playlist. I went a bit wild when I first learned how powerful Sleep Learning is\\n\\nVoice: The female voice is very soothing so it is one you really want to use while sleeping. At first I woke up with headaches but then I adjusted the tracks and played some more soothing music to help me relax. The end of my play list always contains a Rest & Energy Boost.\\n\\nPrice: I pay around 1.99 for each but buying the album is a better deal. You can adjust your play lists from there.\\n\\nWhen To Use: Oddly there was no suggestions but I use this at night when I am trying to sleep. I leave it playing throughout my entire sleep cycle.\\n\\nWhy I use Sleep Learning: I use this to aid with: Sleep Issues, Restless Leg, Focus, ADD, Psoriasis, Healing, Chakra Cleansing, Anger Issues, Dream Work, Energy & Cleansing & Boosting, Saving Money and assistance with College Studies (Being an older student is hard so any extra boost I can get I will take)\\n\\nStarting Track Suggestion: Deep Sleep Induction by Sleep Learning Series (A MUST to start because it will put you out! I am out within 10 minutes) You can find it here but if you get an album it will be included as your first track.:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B008IMZN3Q/dp/B008IMZN3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B008IMZN3Q</a>\\n\\nFinal Track Suggestion: Energy Boost - Since I was getting headaches I make certain to play an energy cleanse and booster track for when I am waking up. You can find Energy Boost here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/B00ADYYZXQ/dp/B00ADYYZXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B00ADYYZXQ</a>\\n\\nMixing Brands? NO - There is a pattern that gets established in your Deep Sleep Induction track. All of the songs by Sleep Learning has that same pattern. When I added a track from a different maker it woke me up every time when I got to that track. I believe you need to remain with the same pattern.\\n\\nHeadaches? This is a sign that you are working your mind too much and too fast while sleeping. Like I said Sleep Learning is very powerful and it works so be mindful of this. I suggest starting on a Friday when you have the weekend off so you can take a few days to adjust your playlists and figure out what works best for you. My headaches started when I was making a 40 song playlist and mixing brands. As soon as I reduced my play list and remained with the same brand they were no longer a factor. I simply make certain that I end with an energy boost or some type of track that will make my mind feel as if it slept for 8 hours.', 'summary': 'Clean your Soul with an Energy Detox', 'unixReviewTime': 1388448000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 3263}\n",

And in their original format? Those two do not.\\n\\nIn both you get what turned out to be his best single of the six, 1968\\'s Grazing In The Grass, which made it to # 1 on both the Billboard Pop Hot 100 and R&B charts, and # 15 Adult Contemporary in June/July on Uni 55066, but only the Millenium disc has the B-side, Bajabula Bonke (The Healing Song). That one also has his first hit, Up-Up And Away, a # 47 R&B and # 71 Hot 100 in January 1968 on Uni 55037, and his fourth, Riot, which ended up at # 21 R&B/# 55 Hot 100 in February 1969 on Uni 5512, which do not appear in th Sony release. It, however, does contain his July 1984 # 67 R&B Don\\'t Go Lose It Baby, which came out on Jive Africa 9193 (the flip was the same song with a dubbed in mix).\\n\\nNeither contains the uncharted B-sides of Up-Up And Away and Riot - Son Of Ice Bag and Mace And Grenades - nor does either have his third hit, Puffin\\' On Down The Track, a # 71 Hot 100 in October 1968 on Uni55085 and its flipside, Do Me So La So So, currently available only in 45 rpm format, and the 1978 hit he shared with Herb Alpert, a cover of the 1954 hit by Ralph Marterie, Skokiaan, which finished at # 87 R&B in May on Horizon 115 and its B-side, African Summer. That\\'s the 45 rpm you see here, and both sides also appear in the 1990 A&M CD Herb Alpert & Hugh Masekla, but it\\'s now only available in used format and at exorbitant prices.\\n\\nIf you like the musical styling of Hugh Masekela and don\\'t really care one way or the other that these may not be original hit single renditions, or even representative of his best, then by all means go for it. As I said, there is nothing wrong with the music in and of itself. But if by his \"best\" you are expecting all his hits stay well clear because both are false advertising by any definition.', 'summary': 'Finding This 1976 R&B Charter  On CD Is Difficult', 'unixReviewTime': 1354579200, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 3450}\n",

Rachmanov can make a melody sing, and his lyrical phrasing, with its frequent use of subito piano and subito pianissimo, can be ravishing. He is less successful, however, in Tchaikovsky's generally-bombastic Piano Sonata. Rachmanov keeps the music moving ahead and wonderfully transparent, but this work also cries out (especially in its frequent moments of vulgarity) for greater spaciousness, pedal and volume!

The closest we will ever come to an official greatest hits album was released as the 2005 live album \"Minimum Maximum\". Unfortunately I\\'ve seen these types of unofficial Kraftwerk releases on a number of occasions. In the early 90s, I stumbled upon a collection called \"The Model\", which if I recall originated from France. It was basically a one-disc greatest hits (covering the Radio Activity, Trans Europe Express, and the Man Machine albums). Then there was the mid-90s collection out of Japan called \"Best of Kraftwerk\", which is even worse (only 9 songs). Now we get this.\\n\\n\"Greatest Hits\" (2 CDs; 29 tracks) is a curious compilation that is heavy on the latter day output, with no less than 7 tracks from \"Tour de France Soundtracks\" (in contrast, only 1 song from \"Radioactivity\" and none from \"Autobahn\", although it does have the title track\\'s live version from \"Minimum Maximum\"). Also please note that there isn\\'t a single note on this compilation that is \"new\" music: all of it has been previously released. Perhaps the most redeeming inclusion on here is the \"Expo 2000\" single (I remember when that came out, I bought it immediately, both the original single and the remix single, as I was sure this would become a hard to find CD single down the road). The sequencing of the 29 tracks on here makes little or no sense. It\\'s as if someone put 29 song names in a hat and then pulled them back out one by one. That said, it is obvious that there is a ton of great music on here, but let me re-emphasize that this is an unauthorized release from Russia that does not in any way, shape or form have the blessing from Kraftwerk. This was released by the same Russian company that released last year\\'s 2CD \"Greatest Hits\" compilation of Coldplay (also unauthorized of course). Buyer beware.\\n\\nTrack listing: CD1: 1.

In an age where there are SO MANY things to discuss and create jokes about. this \"comedian\" resorts to cliched topics, misogyny, and racial humor.  When he is not complaining about women, he get\\'s into race and it is cringe-worthy bad, at time it feels as if he is about to enter into Michael Richards territory. There are a lot of comics that do racial humor but the ones who are successful at it, actually put some thought into it and do it in a smart way and not in a thoughtless and cruel way.  In an arena where there are so many comedians vying for attention, one needs to set themselves apart from the pack, in a good way. Denny\\'s comedy doesn\\'t do that. Each joke is as exhausting and predictable as the next. I listened to each track and do not recall laughing even once. If he wants to have a successful career, he needs to take some time to really explore what comedy is. This album straddles the line of anger and working out his own personal feelings onstage.  The only feeling that I get from this album after listening is, Denny hates women, people of other races, and himself. Instead of telling jokes, perhaps he should work out his issues with a psychologist. All I know is that if this is all he has to bring to the table, this album and his career will end up in the 99 cent bin at a Kentucky Walmart where I am sure the only fans of his reside.', 'summary': 'Career Grenades', 'unixReviewTime': 1358121600, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 3670}\n",

Sacred Hills could just have easily been on his last album \"Mobile Chateau\", It is good, but I\\'m afraid it is going to be one that is going to take multiple listening on a playlist before I truly appreciate it. \"Never Change\" is definitely a folk song, it is probably the prettiest song on the album, it reminds me of an earlier song of his \"Bound\", but it has a more personal sound to it- acoustic guitar, bass, lead vocal with no effect, and a subtle female backing on the chorus,so simply done and so perfectly beautiful.

Jesper Kyd and Lorne Balfe are both extremely talented and composed pieces that reflected the emotions, actions and cultures in the game very well.  Seeing that Liberation was composed by a new composer to the series, Winifred Phillips, made me skeptical as to whether I would enjoy it.\\n\\nI played through the samples to see if it would be of interest to me.  It captured my attention so I ended up purchasing the full soundtrack and am very pleased that I did.  Aveline's story was filled with many different cultures (African-French descent, Lousiana and Mexico locations, Spanish overtaking New Orleans in the 1700s) so the composer had to find a way to mix all of this in to one cohesive soundtrack which she did beautifully.  She made it unique for the character, but managed to make it still sound like an Assassin's Creed soundtrack.\\n\\nTypically I listen to the AC soundtrack's while working because I find they help me focus and also inspire me while coding.

Usher has as of late been assimilating to pop trends in his sound so the fact that this cut sports David Guetta\\'s typical Europop-infused sound is unsurprising.  Usher sounds solid here, maintaining his vocal refinement and playing into pop gimmickry. That said, many in R&B circles would prefer something more along the lines of more contemporary R&B aspirations from Raymond as opposed to his poppy experiments.  Even so, this cut specifically is a most different sound for Ludacris, who is more associated with a southern rap sound.\\n\\nThe main problem with this being a Ludacris cut is that this cut sounds more up Flo Rida\\'s alley than Ludacris\\'s. The guess is that Ludacris and his producers probably feel he needs a huge single in order to deliver commercially on his upcoming album having not been in the spotlight for a couple of years. David Guetta gave The Black Eyed Peas their biggest hit with \"I Gotta Feeling\" (14 weeks at no. 1), so he would be the person to deliver a big hit.  That said, Ludacris is much more of a risqu&eacute; rapper and this cut presents the MC as tame and perhaps even somewhat of a \\'sellout.\\' His verses yield nothing truly notable here and while there is that pop sensibility, you never feel that this is where Ludacris should be going as an artist.  There is nothing wrong with shaking up your style, but \"Rest of My Life\" seems to aim more for pop aspirations as opposed to being a solid rap cut suiting what Ludacris does best.  Maybe it is a better cut than I give it credit for, but this feels completely left of center for Ludacris as an artist.', 'summary': 'Different Sound for Ludacris; Would Suit Flo Rida Better', 'unixReviewTime': 1352160000, 'sentiment': 'positive', 'id': 4218}\n",

I love it, and it's something I could see using in a DJ set. But then something weird happens. The music stops, then you have your stereotypical trancey string elements sweeping in, quickly followed by some piano like sounds. It feels awkward compared to the beginning of the track but okay, I'll follow along and see what happens. Then the beat kicks in. Overall, from 1:08 to 3:30, it sounds like a completely different song with no relevance to the first or last minute. To make matters worse, from 3:54-4:48, that same awesome introduction comes back but, to get there, the poor transition going from 3:26-3:54 really highlights the fact that the middle of the song and the ends do not belong together in the same track. There is even a half beat missing here and there where the transition just suddenly stops at the 3:53 mark; there is this sound that kicks in but suddenly gets cut off while a different sound comes in. This is all in addition to the beginning of the track kicking in at full speed--it sounds like someone chopped this track from the middle of some epic mix and didn't fully include the beginning.\\n\\nAll in all, this track showed promise.
