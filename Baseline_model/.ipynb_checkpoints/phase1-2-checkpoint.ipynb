    "* 1. The simplest possible approach (majority baseline, i.e. everything is positive or noun)\n",
    "* 2. A simple machine learning classifier (logistic regression with words as features)\n",

    "If you plan to have a research question like: can we improve sentiment detection systems by doing X, the answer to the question is the most relevant if you have a competetive baseline (3). In this case we would suggest to use a BiLSTM or even a transformer based model, so that you can re-use the baseline for the final research question (phase 3).\n",
